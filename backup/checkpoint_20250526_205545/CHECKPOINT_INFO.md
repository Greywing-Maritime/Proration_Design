# Checkpoint: 2025-05-26 20:55:45

## Purpose
This checkpoint was created after successfully implementing the **Laytime Commencement Basis Indicator** feature.

## What's Included in This Version

### Feature Implemented
**Laytime Commencement Basis Indicator** - Component #4 from the requested updates

### Changes Made

1. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/components/FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.js` - Added `getLaytimeBasis()` function and display logic

2. **New Files:**
   - `test-laytime-basis.html` - Test file to verify the extraction logic
   - `implementation-laytime-basis.md` - Documentation of the implementation

### Feature Details

The laytime basis indicator:
- Automatically extracts laytime commencement method from timeline events
- Displays in two locations:
  - Port header (as a badge next to port name)
  - Port overview statistics grid
- Recognizes three patterns:
  - MADE FAST (Kuala Tanjung)
  - NOR + 6 HOURS (Kandla, Port Qasim)
  - NOR TENDERED (fallback)

### Current State
