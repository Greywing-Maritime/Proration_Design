## Cargo Visualization Enhancement Log

This log details the development process for enhancing the cargo proration visualization tool. It covers feature requests, problems encountered, and solutions implemented.

### Initial Feature Requests

The user requested several improvements to the cargo visualization:

1.  **Prevent Final Port Cut-off**: Ensure the visualization for the last port in the sequence is not cut off and shows all events, including departure or COSP (Completion of Sea Passage).
2.  **Loading/Discharging Separation**: Display cargo lines for loading operations on the left side of the centerline and discharging operations on the right. The centerline should dynamically shift to optimize space if a port has predominantly one type of operation.
3.  **Dynamic Responsive Layout**: Make the cargo lines and overall layout respond dynamically to the available screen space, expanding or contracting for clarity.
4.  **Fix Line Overlaps**: Address an issue where cargo lines (e.g., green SOF6 and yellow SOF5) were overlapping during operations instead of maintaining distinct paths, as per design guidelines.

### Implementation and Problem Solving

#### 1. Preventing Final Port Cut-off

*   **Problem**: The SVG container height was not sufficient to render all events for the final port, leading to a cut-off appearance.
*   **Solution**: Modified the `totalHeight` calculation in `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js` to be more accurate and added more padding:

    ```javascript
    // In processPortData function, increased padding for the last event of a port:
    processedPorts[portName] = {
      // ... other properties
      endY: enrichedEvents.length > 0 ? enrichedEvents[enrichedEvents.length - 1].y + 120 : currentY // Increased padding
    };
    currentY += 200; // Increased spacing between ports

    // Refined totalHeight calculation in the main useEffect hook:
    const totalHeight = Math.max(800, Object.values(processedPorts).reduce(
      (acc, port) => Math.max(acc, port.endY + 150), 100 // Ensures enough space after the last port's endY
    ));
    ```
    Also ensured that events like 'COSP' contribute to event spacing decisions.

#### 2. Loading/Discharging Separation & Dynamic Centerline

*   **Problem**: Cargo lines were not differentiated by operation type (loading/discharging), and the centerline was static.
*   **Solution**: Implemented logic in `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js`:
    *   Added a `getCargoOperationType` helper function to determine if a cargo is loading or discharging based on event names (e.g., "Loading Commenced", "Discharging Commenced") or fallback to `cargoTypes` data (`loadPort`, `dischargePort`).
    *   Modified `processPortData` to categorize cargoes into `loadingCargoes` and `dischargingCargoes` arrays for each port.
    *   Calculated an `centerX` that shifts based on the ratio of loading to discharging cargoes:
        ```javascript
        let centerX;
        if (totalLoading === 0) { // Only discharging
          centerX = responsiveMargin + (usableWidth * 0.3);
        } else if (totalDischarging === 0) { // Only loading
          centerX = responsiveMargin + (usableWidth * 0.7);
        } else { // Mixed
          const loadingRatio = totalLoading / totalCargoes;
          centerX = responsiveMargin + (usableWidth * (0.3 + (0.4 * loadingRatio)));
        }
        ```
    *   Positioned loading cargoes to the left and discharging cargoes to the right of this dynamic `centerX` during their operations.
    *   Added "← LOADING" and "DISCHARGING →" labels to the visualization for clarity.

#### 3. Dynamic Responsive Layout

*   **Problem**: The visualization did not adapt well to different screen sizes.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Introduced a `containerWidth` state variable in `TubeMapVisualization.js`, updated by a `resize` event listener on the window. This state triggers re-renders and recalculations.
        ```javascript
        const [containerWidth, setContainerWidth] = useState(1000);
        useEffect(() => {
          const updateDimensions = () => {
            if (svgRef.current && svgRef.current.parentElement) {
              setContainerWidth(svgRef.current.parentElement.clientWidth);
            }
          };
          window.addEventListener('resize', updateDimensions);
          updateDimensions(); // Initial call
          return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', updateDimensions);
        }, []);
        ```
    *   The `processPortData` function now takes `containerWidth` as an argument and uses it for calculations like `responsiveMargin` and `usableWidth`.
    *   The `getResponsiveSpacing` function was updated to calculate spacing based on available width and number of cargoes, ensuring it respects minimum and maximum spacing constraints.
    *   Added responsive CSS rules in `src/App.css` to adjust line widths and other visual elements at different breakpoints (e.g., 1600px, 1200px, 768px).

#### 4. Fixing Cargo Line Overlaps (e.g., SOF5 & SOF6)

*   **Problem**: A specific overlap was observed between the green (SOF6) and yellow (SOF5) lines, indicating an error in the positioning logic for breakout operations, particularly for discharging cargoes.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Corrected Positioning Logic**: The primary fix was in `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js` within the `allCargoes.forEach` loop where `targetX` is calculated. The formula for discharging cargoes was incorrect.
        ```javascript
        // OLD (Incorrect - led to overlaps for discharging side)
        // const groupWidth = (groupSize - 1) * spacing;
        // const groupStartX = centerX + (groupWidth / 2) - groupWidth + spacing;
        // targetX = groupStartX + (cargoIndex * spacing);

        // NEW (Corrected logic for discharging cargoes)
        if (isLoading) {
          targetX = centerX - spacing - (cargoIndex * spacing);
        } else { // Discharging
          targetX = centerX + spacing + (cargoIndex * spacing);
        }
        ```
    *   **Refined `getResponsiveSpacing`**: Ensured the function correctly divides `availableSpace` and always respects the `minSpacing` of 80px.
        ```javascript
        const getResponsiveSpacing = (numCargoes, availableSpace) => {
          const minSpacing = 80; // Enforced minimum
          // ... other constants ...
          const possibleSpacing = availableSpace / (numCargoes + 1); // Corrected divisor
          const actualSpacing = Math.max(minSpacing, Math.min(maxSpacing, possibleSpacing));
          return actualSpacing;
        };
        ```
    *   **Position Validation (Defensive Coding)**: Added a mechanism to check for and attempt to resolve overlaps if cargoes were still assigned too-close positions. This involves iterating through `operationalCargoes`, checking `roundedX` positions, and applying an `adjustment` if a conflict is found.
        ```javascript
        // Inside enrichedEvents mapping, after initial cargoPositions are set:
        const operationalCargoes = allCargoes.filter(cargoId => cargoPositions[cargoId]?.isInOperations);
        if (operationalCargoes.length > 1) {
          const positionMap = new Map();
          operationalCargoes.forEach(cargoId => {
            const pos = cargoPositions[cargoId];
            const roundedX = Math.round(pos.x);
            if (positionMap.has(roundedX)) {
              console.warn(`Position conflict detected...`);
              const adjustment = pos.side === 'right' ? 85 : -85;
              pos.x += adjustment;
            }
            positionMap.set(roundedX, cargoId);
          });
        }
        ```
    *   **Consistent Z-Ordering**: Ensured cargo lines are appended to the SVG in a consistent order (sorted by `cargoId`) to make visual debugging of overlaps easier.
    *   **CSS for Overlap Visibility**: Added `paint-order: stroke fill;` and other properties to `.cargo-line.has-breakout` in `src/App.css` to make the stroke appear on top of the fill, which can help visually identify subtle overlaps.

### User-Implemented Changes (Observed via File Watcher)

The user made several modifications directly to `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js` and `src/App.css`. These changes include:

*   **New Props**: Added `greyOutNonUnilever` and `onPortInView` props to `TubeMapVisualization`.
*   **Port Positions State**: Introduced `portPositions` state for scroll detection.
*   **Focused Port View**: Logic to process and display only the `activePort` at the top of the visualization if one is selected.
*   **Dynamic Event Spacing**: Reworked `getEventSpacing` to be more dynamic, considering estimated text lines, text block height, and specific padding for different event types. Increased overall spacing.
*   **Overall Left Shift**: Applied a `leftShift` to the entire visualization to create more space on the right, aiming to reduce text truncation.
*   **CenterX Adjustment**: Further adjusted `centerX` calculations, incorporating the `leftShift`.
*   **Total Height Calculation**: Modified `totalHeight` to use a fixed height (e.g., 1200px) for single port views to prevent page jumps, and dynamic calculation for "all ports" view.
*   **SVG ViewBox**: Added `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio` to the SVG element.
*   **Styling and Layout Adjustments**: Reduced margins for port titles and time backgrounds. Changed `hasBreakout` logic. Used `tankDesignation` for CSS classes. Changed stroke color based on `greyOutNonUnilever`.
*   **Advanced Text Wrapping**: Implemented a sophisticated `dynamicWrapText` function with multiple strategies to wrap event labels, considering potential intersections with cargo lines, and replacing SOF IDs with tank designations.
*   **Scroll Detection**: Added a `useEffect` hook to detect which port is currently in the center of the viewport when `activePort` is 'all' and calls `onPortInView`.
*   **CSS Restructuring (`App.css`)**: Significant changes to `App.css`, including new layout classes (`.main-layout`, `.visualization-area`, `.sidebar-area`, `.right-sidebar`), responsive adjustments for these new layouts, and modifications to SVG element styles (`.tube-map-container`, `.tube-map-svg`) and text element styles (`.station-label`, `.station-time`). Deprecated several old layout classes.

These user-driven changes focus heavily on improving text legibility, UI layout for different screen sizes, and adding interactivity related to port visibility on scroll.

### Feature: Unilever Cargo Focus Toggle and Enhanced Cargo Modal Layout

This set of changes introduced two main enhancements: a toggle to visually isolate Unilever cargoes and a significant redesign of the cargo status modal for better responsiveness and space utilization.

#### 1. Unilever Cargo Focus Toggle

*   **Feature Request**: The user wanted a button to grey out all non-Unilever cargoes, making Unilever cargoes visually prominent while retaining the context of other charterers.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   **State Management (`src/App.js`)**: Added a new state variable `greyOutNonUnilever` (boolean, default `false`) and a corresponding handler `toggleGreyOutNonUnilever`.
        ```javascript
        // In App.js
        const [greyOutNonUnilever, setGreyOutNonUnilever] = useState(false);

        const toggleGreyOutNonUnilever = () => {
          setGreyOutNonUnilever(!greyOutNonUnilever);
        };

        // This state was also added to the resetView function:
        const resetView = () => {
          // ... other resets ...
          setGreyOutNonUnilever(false);
        };
        ```
    *   **Control Panel Button (`src/components/ControlPanel.js`)**: Added a new button in the "Display Options" section.
        *   The button text changes dynamically: "Focus Unilever" (when off) or "Show All" (when on).
        *   The button is styled to appear active (red background, white text) when the `greyOutNonUnilever` state is true.
        ```javascript
        // In ControlPanel.js render method, within Display Options btn-group:
        <button
          className={greyOutNonUnilever ? 'btn active' : 'btn'}
          onClick={onToggleGreyOutNonUnilever}
          style={{ 
            background: greyOutNonUnilever ? '#e32017' : '',
            color: greyOutNonUnilever ? 'white' : ''
          }}
        >
          {greyOutNonUnilever ? 'Show All' : 'Focus Unilever'}
        </button>
        ```
    *   **Visualization Update (`src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js`)**: The component now accepts the `greyOutNonUnilever` prop. The color of cargo lines and individual station circles is conditionally set to grey (`#999`) if `greyOutNonUnilever` is true and the `cargoInfo.charterer` is not "UNILEVER".
        ```javascript
        // In TubeMapVisualization.js, when rendering cargo lines:
        .attr('stroke', greyOutNonUnilever && cargoInfo.charterer !== 'UNILEVER' ? '#999' : cargoInfo.color)

        // And for individual station circles:
        .attr('fill', greyOutNonUnilever && cargoInfo.charterer !== 'UNILEVER' ? '#999' : cargoInfo.color)
        ```
    *   **Cargo Status Modal Update (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`)**: Similarly, the cargo indicator dots in the header pills also respect the `greyOutNonUnilever` prop.
        ```javascript
        // In CargoStatusModal.js, for the cargo indicator span:
        style={{ backgroundColor: greyOutNonUnilever && cargo.charterer !== 'UNILEVER' ? '#999' : cargo.color }}
        ```
*   **Problem Overcome**: Ensured consistent application of the grey-out logic across all relevant visual elements (lines, stations, header pills).

#### 2. Enhanced Cargo Modal Layout (Single Row, Scrollable/Compressible)

*   **Feature Request**: The user requested that the cargo pills in the `CargoStatusModal` be displayed in a single horizontal row. If there are 12 or fewer cargoes, they should compress to fit the width. If more than 12, horizontal scrolling with navigation buttons should be enabled.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   **CSS Changes (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.css`)**:
        *   Changed `.cargo-grid` from `display: grid` to `display: flex`.
        *   Added a wrapper `.cargo-grid-container` with `overflow: hidden` and `position: relative` to house the scrollable grid and navigation buttons.
        *   Implemented two main states for `.cargo-grid`:
            *   `.fit-to-width`: Used when cargo count ≤ 12. Cargo items use `flex: 1` and `max-width` calculations (e.g., `calc((100% - 110px) / 12)`) to distribute space.
            *   `.scrollable`: Used when cargo count > 12. Cargo items have a fixed `width` (e.g., `140px`), and `overflow-x: auto` is enabled on `.cargo-grid`. Scrollbars are hidden via CSS.
        *   Added styles for `.scroll-button` (left/right arrows), including positioning, appearance, and disabled states.
        *   Included responsive adjustments for `max-width` in `.fit-to-width` mode and `width` in `.scrollable` mode at various breakpoints (1400px, 1200px, 1024px, 900px, 768px, 640px) to control how many items attempt to fit before scrolling is enforced or how wide items are when scrolling.
    *   **Component Logic (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`)**:
        *   Added state variables: `scrollPosition`, `canScrollLeft`, `canScrollRight`.
        *   Used `useRef` for `cargoGridRef` to directly manipulate scroll properties.
        *   An effect hook (`useEffect`) monitors `cargoGridRef.current` for scroll events to update `canScrollLeft` and `canScrollRight` states, enabling/disabling navigation buttons.
        *   `scrollLeft` and `scrollRight` functions use `cargoGridRef.current.scrollBy()` for smooth scrolling.
        *   Calculated `needsScrolling = cargoCount > 12` to conditionally render scroll buttons and apply `.scrollable` or `.fit-to-width` CSS classes.
        ```javascript
        // In CargoStatusModal.js
        const cargoCount = Object.keys(currentCargoes).length;
        const needsScrolling = cargoCount > 12;

        // ... in useEffect for scroll buttons ...
        const { scrollLeft, scrollWidth, clientWidth } = cargoGridRef.current;
        setCanScrollLeft(scrollLeft > 0);
        setCanScrollRight(scrollLeft < scrollWidth - clientWidth - 1); // -1 for precision

        // ... in JSX ...
        <div 
          ref={cargoGridRef}
          className={`cargo-grid ${needsScrolling ? 'scrollable' : 'fit-to-width'}`}
        >
          {/* ... cargo items ... */}
        </div>
        {needsScrolling && (
          <button 
            className={`scroll-button left ${!canScrollLeft ? 'disabled' : ''}`}
            onClick={scrollLeft}
            disabled={!canScrollLeft}
          >
            {/* SVG icon */}
          </button>
        )}
        {/* Similar button for right scroll */}
        ```
*   **Problem Overcome**: Managing the dual behavior (fit vs. scroll) based on item count and ensuring the scroll buttons function correctly and only appear when needed. Fine-tuning the `max-width` calculations for different screen sizes in `fit-to-width` mode was crucial for good visual compression.

#### 3. Flexible Main Layout (Control Panel Positioning)

*   **Feature Request**: The user noticed that the Control Panel (which contains various controls and the `TimeTrackingPanel`) was being pushed below the main visualization area too early on screen resize (at 1200px). They wanted it to remain on the right side for as long as possible, only stacking vertically on very small screens (like an iPhone in portrait mode).
*   **Implementation Details (`src/index.css`)**:
    *   The primary layout is controlled by `.main-content { display: flex; }`.
    *   The previous media query `@media (max-width: 1200px)` that set `flex-direction: column` on `.main-content` was too broad.
    *   **New Responsive Strategy**: Introduced a series of media queries to gradually reduce the `width` of the `.control-panel` as the screen narrows, allowing the side-by-side layout to persist longer.
        *   `@media (max-width: 1200px)`: `.control-panel` width to `280px`.
        *   `@media (max-width: 1024px)`: `.control-panel` width to `260px`.
        *   `@media (max-width: 900px)`: `.control-panel` width to `240px`, reduced `gap` in `.main-content`.
        *   `@media (max-width: 768px)`: `.control-panel` width to `220px`, further reduced `gap`.
    *   **iPhone-Specific Stacking**: The `flex-direction: column` for `.main-content` (which causes stacking) is now only applied `@media (max-width: 640px)`. At this point, `.control-panel` reverts to `width: 100%`.
        ```css
        /* src/index.css snippet */
        .main-content {
          display: flex;
          gap: 24px; /* Default gap */
          flex: 1;
        }

        .control-panel {
          width: 320px; /* Default width */
          /* ... other styles ... */
        }

        /* Example of progressive narrowing */
        @media (max-width: 1200px) {
          .control-panel {
            width: 280px;
          }
        }

        /* Stacking only on very small screens */
        @media (max-width: 640px) {
          .main-content {
            flex-direction: column;
          }
          .control-panel {
            width: 100%;
            max-width: none;
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **CargoStatusModal.css Adjustments**: Corresponding changes were made to the responsive breakpoints in `CargoStatusModal.css` to ensure the cargo pill compression and scrolling logic aligned with the new main layout breakpoints. This primarily involved adjusting the `max-width` calculations for `.cargo-grid.fit-to-width .cargo-item` at different screen sizes.
*   **Problem Overcome**: The main challenge was to find a balance where the control panel remained usable on the side for as many screen sizes as possible without causing the main visualization to become too cramped. This required a more granular approach to responsive design breakpoints than previously implemented.

### Feature: Prioritize and Reposition Focused Port in Main Visualization

*   **Feature Request**: When a user selects a specific port for focus (e.g., "Kandla") from the Control Panel, the main visualization area should not just hide other ports but also bring the selected port's timeline to the top of the view. This prevents the user from having to scroll down to find the focused port, especially if it was originally positioned further down the page.

*   **Initial Misunderstanding & Problem Clarification**:
    *   Initially, there was some confusion, and my responses focused on the visibility and sorting of the *top cargo status modal*. 
    *   The user clarified that the top modal was working as intended, but the *main tube map visualization* area was the problem. When a port like "Kandla" was selected, the other ports (Kuala Tanjung, Port Qasim) would disappear (as expected), but the Kandla timeline would remain in its original vertical position, often far down the page, requiring the user to scroll significantly to see it.

*   **Identifying the Core Issue**:
    *   The `currentY` variable in `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js` (within the `processPortData` function) was being continuously incremented for each port. This meant that even if only one port was being rendered (the `activePort`), it would still render at its original, potentially far-down, Y-coordinate.
    *   A line of code, `if (activePort !== 'all' && activePort !== portName) return;`, was also present in the rendering loop (`Object.entries(processedPorts).forEach(...)`). While `portsToProcess` already handled filtering, this line was redundant but not the primary cause of the scrolling issue.

*   **Solution Implemented (`src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js`)**:
    1.  **Dynamic Port Processing and Positioning**:
        *   The `processPortData` function was modified to be aware of the `activePort`.
        *   A new constant `portsToProcess` was introduced. If `activePort` is not 'all', `portsToProcess` becomes an array containing only the data for the `activePort`. Otherwise, it processes all ports.
        *   **Key Fix**: When `activePort` is a specific port, `currentY` (the starting vertical position for drawing a port's timeline) is reset to a small value (e.g., `50`) *before* processing that port. This ensures the selected port always starts drawing near the top of the SVG.
        ```javascript
        // In processPortData function in TubeMapVisualization.js
        const processPortData = (containerWidth = 1000) => {
          const processedPorts = {};
          let currentY = 50; // Initial Y for the very first port or reset point

          // If a specific port is selected, process only that port and position it at the top
          const portsToProcess = activePort !== 'all' 
            ? [[activePort, portOperations[activePort]]]
            : Object.entries(portOperations);

          portsToProcess.forEach(([portName, portData]) => {
            // Reset Y position for focused port to start at top
            if (activePort !== 'all' && portName === activePort) {
              currentY = 50; // Ensures the selected port starts at the top
            }

            // ... (rest of the port event Y calculation and processing) ...
            // currentY will be incremented based on this port's events

            processedPorts[portName] = {
              // ... port data ...
              startY: /* calculated start Y based on the (potentially reset) currentY */,
              endY: /* calculated end Y */
            };

            // If showing all ports, add spacing for the next port
            if (activePort === 'all') {
              currentY += 200; // Spacing between ports when all are shown
            }
          });
          return processedPorts;
        };
        ```

    2.  **Removal of Redundant Rendering Filter**:
        *   The line `if (activePort !== 'all' && activePort !== portName) return;` within the `Object.entries(processedPorts).forEach(...)` loop (which renders the SVG elements) was removed. This is because the `portsToProcess` logic in `processPortData` now ensures that `processedPorts` itself only contains the port(s) that should be rendered. 

    3.  **Automatic Scroll to Top of Visualization**:
        *   A new `useEffect` hook was added to `TubeMapVisualization.js` that triggers when `activePort` changes.
        *   If `activePort` is a specific port (not 'all'), it finds the `.visualization-container` element and scrolls it to the top smoothly.
        ```javascript
        // In TubeMapVisualization.js
        useEffect(() => {
          if (activePort && activePort !== 'all' && svgRef.current) {
            const visualizationContainer = svgRef.current.closest('.visualization-container');
            if (visualizationContainer) {
              visualizationContainer.scrollTo({ 
                top: 0, 
                behavior: 'smooth' 
              });
            }
          }
        }, [activePort]);
        ```

*   **Outcome**: When a user now selects a specific port like "Kandla", the Kandla timeline is rendered starting from the top of the `TubeMapVisualization` area, and the view automatically scrolls to show it. This provides immediate focus on the selected port without requiring manual scrolling, significantly improving usability.

### Feature: Enhanced Cargo Modal Port Prioritization

*   **Feature Request**: When a user selects a specific port for focus in the Control Panel, the cargo pills in the *top cargo status modal* should also reflect this focus. Specifically, cargoes related to the selected port (either loading at or discharging to that port) should be moved to the beginning of the list of cargo pills.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    1.  **Prop Drilling (`src/App.js`)**: The `activePort` state from `App.js` was passed down as a prop to the `CargoStatusModal` component.
        ```javascript
        // In App.js, within the return statement:
        <CargoStatusModal 
          // ... other props ...
          activePort={activePort}
        />
        ```
    2.  **Component Prop Update (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`)**: The `CargoStatusModal` component was updated to accept and use the `activePort` prop.
    3.  **Modified Sorting Logic (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`)**: The `getSortedCargoes` function was enhanced:
        *   **Primary Sort Key**: If `activePort` is a specific port (not 'all'), cargoes where `acargo.loadPort === activePort || acargo.dischargePort === activePort` are prioritized (moved to the front).
        *   **Secondary Sort Key**: Within the port-prioritized group (and for all cargoes if `activePort` is 'all'), Unilever cargoes come first.
        *   **Tertiary Sort Key**: Finally, cargoes are sorted by their `cargoHold` (tank designation) in ascending order.
        ```javascript
        // In getSortedCargoes function in CargoStatusModal.js
        if (activePort && activePort !== 'all') {
          const aHasActivePort = acargo.loadPort === activePort || acargo.dischargePort === activePort;
          const bHasActivePort = bcargo.loadPort === activePort || bcargo.dischargePort === activePort;
          if (aHasActivePort && !bHasActivePort) return -1;
          if (!aHasActivePort && bHasActivePort) return 1;
        }
        // ... then by charterer, then by cargoHold ...
        ```
    4.  **Visual Feedback for Prioritized Cargoes (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js` & `src/components/CargoStatusModal.css`)**:
        *   A new CSS class `.port-prioritized` was created with distinct styling (blue top/left borders, lighter blue background, enhanced shadow, slight scale transform, and a "📍" pin icon pseudo-element).
        *   When rendering cargo items, if `activePort` is set and the cargo involves that port, the `.port-prioritized` class is added.
        *   A new badge "📍 [Selected Port Name]" was added to the `vessel-badges` section of the modal to clearly indicate which port focus is active.
        *   The modal was made to automatically scroll into view using `modalRef.current.scrollIntoView()` when `activePort` changes to ensure the user sees the prioritized items.

*   **Outcome**: When a port is selected, the top cargo modal now clearly highlights and brings forward the relevant cargo pills, providing immediate visual confirmation and easy access to details for the focused port. This works in conjunction with the main visualization update.

### Feature: Remove Unwanted Page Scrolling and Refine Control Panel

This set of changes focused on resolving an unwanted page scrolling behavior when a port was selected for focus and on refining the control panel by removing unused buttons and adjusting the behavior of the "Focus Unilever" button.

#### 1. Fixing Unwanted Page Scroll on Port Selection

*   **Problem**: When a specific port (e.g., "Kandla") was selected from the Control Panel, the entire page would scroll, causing the top cargo status modal to enter its "sticky" state. This was happening despite previous fixes related to SVG height and explicit `scrollTo` calls in the `TubeMapVisualization` component.
*   **Initial Incorrect Diagnosis**: We initially thought the issue was still related to the `TubeMapVisualization` component or its SVG height calculation.
*   **Identifying the True Culprit**: After further investigation using `grep_search` for `scrollIntoView`, we discovered that the `CargoStatusModal.js` component had its own `useEffect` hook that was causing the scroll.
    ```javascript
    // Problematic code in src/components/CargoStatusModal.js (now removed)
    useEffect(() => {
      if (activePort && activePort !== 'all' && modalRef.current) {
        modalRef.current.scrollIntoView({ 
          behavior: 'smooth', 
          block: 'start' 
        });
      }
    }, [activePort]);
    ```
*   **Solution**: This `useEffect` hook, which was intended to bring the modal into view when `activePort` changed, was removed from `src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`.
    ```javascript
    // Edit in src/components/CargoStatusModal.js
    // ... (previous code) ...
    const sortedCargoes = getSortedCargoes();
    const cargoCount = sortedCargoes.length;
    const unileverCargoCount = getUnileverCargoCount();
    const needsScrolling = cargoCount > 12;

    // REMOVED THE PROBLEMATIC useEffect that called scrollIntoView

    return (
      <div 
        ref={modalRef}
        className={`cargo-status-modal ${isSticky ? 'sticky' : ''} compression-${compressionLevel}`}
      >
    // ... (rest of the component)
    ```
*   **Outcome**: Removing this `scrollIntoView` call from the `CargoStatusModal` resolved the page jumping issue. Now, selecting a port updates the visualization and modal content without any unwanted page movement.

#### 2. Refining Control Panel Buttons

*   **Feature Request**: The user requested the removal of the "Show Event Flow" and "Highlight Concurrent Ops" buttons. They also wanted the "Focus Unilever" button to be red when active (default state) and blue when inactive, always displaying the text "Focus Unilever".
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   **Button Removal (`src/components/ControlPanel.js`)**: The JSX for "Show Event Flow" and "Highlight Concurrent Ops" buttons was removed from the `render` method of `ControlPanel.js`.
    *   **Focus Unilever Button Style & Text Update (`src/components/ControlPanel.js`)**: The style for the "Focus Unilever" button was changed to be `background: greyOutNonUnilever ? '#e32017' : '#0019a8'` (red when active, blue when not) and `color: 'white'`. The button text was hardcoded to "Focus Unilever".
        ```javascript
        // In ControlPanel.js, Display Options section
        <button
          className={greyOutNonUnilever ? 'btn active' : 'btn'}
          onClick={onToggleGreyOutNonUnilever}
          style={{ 
            background: greyOutNonUnilever ? '#e32017' : '#0019a8',
            color: 'white'
          }}
        >
          Focus Unilever
        </button>
        ```
    *   **Default State Change (`src/App.js`)**: The initial state for `greyOutNonUnilever` in `App.js` was changed from `false` to `true`, making "Focus Unilever" active by default.
        ```javascript
        // In App.js
        const [greyOutNonUnilever, setGreyOutNonUnilever] = useState(true); // Changed to true
        
        // Also updated in resetView function:
        const resetView = () => {
          // ... other resets ...
          setGreyOutNonUnilever(true); // Changed to true
        };
        ```
    *   **Prop Cleanup**: Unused props related to the removed buttons (`showEventFlow`, `highlightSimultaneous`, `onToggleEventFlow`, `onToggleSimultaneous`) were removed from `App.js`, `ControlPanel.js`, and `TubeMapVisualization.js`.
*   **Outcome**: The Control Panel is now cleaner. The "Focus Unilever" button has the desired default state and color behavior, improving UI consistency.

#### 3. Reorganizing Sidebar Content (Key Insights & Legend)

*   **Feature Request**: The user asked to remove the "Key Insights" section from the sidebar and move the "Legend" section from the `ControlPanel` to be the last item at the bottom of the `TimeTrackingPanel`.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   **Removing Key Insights (`src/components/TimeTrackingPanel.js`)**: The JSX block rendering the "Key Insights" section was removed from `TimeTrackingPanel.js`.
    *   **Moving the Legend**:
        1.  **Removed from `ControlPanel.js`**: The JSX for the "Legend" section was deleted from the end of `ControlPanel.js`.
        2.  **Added to `TimeTrackingPanel.js`**: The same JSX block for the Legend was added to the end of the `TimeTrackingPanel.js` component, inside the main returned `div` but after the active port data and any other analysis sections.
        ```javascript
        // In TimeTrackingPanel.js, towards the end of the main return block:
              </>
            );
          })()}
        </div>
      )}

      {/* Legend (MOVED HERE) */}
      <div style={{ /* ... styling ... */ }}>
        <h4 style={{ /* ... styling ... */ }}>Legend</h4>
        <div style={{ /* ... styling ... */ }}>
          {/* ... legend content ... */}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* CSS for styling */}
      // ...
        ```
*   **Outcome**: The sidebar layout is now reorganized as requested, with the "Key Insights" removed and the "Legend" appearing at the bottom of the `TimeTrackingPanel`.

### Session 2024-05-28 - Further UI Refinements and Data Display Corrections

This session focused on refining the display of laytime information, ensuring correct cargo counting after data model changes, and investigating discrepancies in the Port Qasim cargo operations visualization.

#### 1. Laytime Rate Display and Port Name Abbreviation

*   **Feature Request**:
    1.  Display laytime rates separately for loading and discharging operations (e.g., "Load: 150 MTPH - Discharge: 150 MTPH").
    2.  Implement a rule for the "Quick View" in the Voyage Summary to use full port names by default, but switch to UNLOCODE identifiers if the full names are too long and would be truncated.
*   **Problem Overcome**: The previous display combined load/discharge rates and always used UNLOCODEs in the quick view, which was less readable.
*   **Solution Implemented (AI-Assisted in `src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`)**:
    *   Modified the laytime rate display string:
        ```javascript
        // In CargoStatusModal.js, voyage-summary-details section
        <span class="rate-value">Load: {laytimeData.laytimeRate} MTPH - Discharge: {laytimeData.laytimeRate} MTPH</span>
        ```
    *   Updated the corresponding section in the `exportVoyageSummary` function:
        ```javascript
        // In exportVoyageSummary function
        rate: `Load: ${laytimeData.laytimeRate} MTPH - Discharge: ${laytimeData.laytimeRate} MTPH`,
        ```
    *   Added logic to the "Quick View" port breakdown mapping:
        ```javascript
        // In CargoStatusModal.js, port-breakdown section
        {laytimeData.portBreakdown.map((port, index) => {
          const portNameMap = { /* ... UNLOCODE to Full Name ... */ };
          const totalPortNamesLength = laytimeData.portBreakdown.reduce(/* ... calculate length ... */, 0);
          const useUNLOCODE = totalPortNamesLength > 80 || compressionLevel >= 2;
          const displayName = useUNLOCODE ? port.port : (portNameMap[port.port] || port.port);
          return ( /* ... span with displayName ... */ );
        })}
        ```
    *   Updated a comment regarding the laytime rate in `calculateVoyageLaytime` to reflect the change from `(Load/Discharge)` to `for both load and discharge operations`.

#### 2. Proportional Laytime Bars and Unilever Cargo Count Correction

*   **Feature Request**:
    1.  Make the "Allowed", "Used", and "Demurrage" bars in the Voyage Laytime Status proportional to each other.
    2.  Change bar colors: Allowed (Green), Used (Blue), Demurrage (Red).
    3.  Correct the Unilever cargo count in the header badge to show 4 (as there are 4 Unilever tanks involved), instead of 2 (which was based on cargo parcels).
*   **Problems Overcome**:
    *   Laytime bars were not visually representative of the actual time proportions (Allowed bar was always 100%).
    *   Cargo count was reflecting cargo parcels rather than the number of tanks/pills displayed, which had been updated by the user to represent individual tanks.
*   **Solution Implemented (AI-Assisted)**:
    *   **Proportional Bars & Colors (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js` and `src/components/CargoStatusModal.css`)**:
        *   Updated inline styles for bar widths in `CargoStatusModal.js`:
            ```javascript
            // Allowed bar
            width: `${(laytimeData.allowed / Math.max(laytimeData.used, laytimeData.allowed)) * 100}%`,
            backgroundColor: '#27ae60' // Green

            // Used bar
            width: `${Math.min(100, (laytimeData.used / Math.max(laytimeData.used, laytimeData.allowed)) * 100)}%`,
            backgroundColor: '#3498db' // Blue

            // Demurrage bar
            width: `${(laytimeData.demurrage / Math.max(laytimeData.used, laytimeData.allowed)) * 100}%`,
            backgroundColor: '#e74c3c' // Red
            ```
        *   Updated corresponding CSS classes in `CargoStatusModal.css` to reflect new background colors and ensure opacity was correct for the "Allowed" bar (changed from a dim #95a5a6 with opacity 0.3 to the vibrant green #27ae60 with opacity 1).
            ```css
            /* In CargoStatusModal.css */
            .laytime-bar-fill.allowed {
              background: #27ae60; /* Green for allowed */
              opacity: 1;
            }
            .laytime-bar-fill.used {
              background: #3498db; /* Blue for used */
            }
            .laytime-bar-fill.demurrage { /* Ensured color and added if missing */
              background: #e74c3c; /* Red for demurrage */
            }
            ```
    *   **Unilever Cargo Count (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`)**:
        *   The user had previously refactored `cargoData.js` to use `tankData` for the modal's cargo pills. `currentCargoes` state in the modal is populated from this `tankData`.
        *   The `getUnileverCargoCount` function was updated to count these individual tanks from `currentCargoes`:
            ```javascript
            // In getUnileverCargoCount function of CargoStatusModal.js
            const getUnileverCargoCount = () => {
              // Count all Unilever cargo tanks (not split groups)
              const unileverTanks = Object.values(currentCargoes).filter(cargo => cargo.charterer === 'UNILEVER');
              return unileverTanks.length;
            };
            ```
        *   This change aligned the counting logic with the user's data restructuring for tank-based display in the modal.

#### 3. Investigating Port Qasim Cargo Operations Display

*   **User Request**: Ensure the cargo operations at Port Qasim are displayed correctly in the tube map visualization, as they appeared amiss in relation to the `dataToUse.md` and the latest `cargoData.js`. Specifically, Unilever's CARGO2 (Stearin, tanks 5S & 6P) operations at Port Qasim were not rendering as expected in the user-provided screenshot.
*   **Problem Analysis**:
    *   The user provided an image showing the Port Qasim visualization where Unilever cargo operations were not clearly visible or correctly represented. This was despite the `dataToUse.md` and the updated `src/data/cargoData.js` (provided by the user in the prompt of 2024-05-28) detailing these specific operations.
    *   Analysis of `src/data/cargoData.js` (version provided by user on 2024-05-28) confirmed that:
        *   `cargoTypes.CARGO2` (Unilever Stearin) is designated to discharge at Port Qasim (`dischargePort: "Port Qasim"`).
        *   `portOperations["Port Qasim"].timeline` includes specific events for `CARGO2`, such as "5S,6P Hose Connected (UNILEVER)", "5S,6P Discharging Commenced (UNILEVER)", and "5S,6P Operations Complete (UNILEVER)". This data was part of user-driven updates.
    *   The `TubeMapVisualization.js` component (heavily modified by the user as per previous log entries) contains logic to check `e.activeCargoes.includes(cargoId)` which *should* allow these cargoes to be rendered if they are correctly listed in `activeCargoes` for the timeline events.
*   **Conclusion of Investigation (as of this session)**:
    *   The primary data in `src/data/cargoData.js` (as updated by the user and confirmed in this session's context) correctly defines that Unilever's CARGO2 (Stearin) is handled at Port Qasim and includes detailed timeline events for its discharge.
    *   The discrepancy noted by the user (the visualization in the screenshot not matching the detailed data) likely stems from how the complex, user-modified rendering logic within `TubeMapVisualization.js` (e.g., path generation for cargo lines, breakout logic for individual operations, event label positioning, z-indexing) is interpreting or displaying these specific Unilever events within the Port Qasim timeline.
    *   The `developmentlog.md` already documents extensive user-driven modifications to `TubeMapVisualization.js`. The current display issue for Port Qasim appears to be an interaction between this heavily modified component and the detailed Port Qasim operational data.
*   **Resolution Path Indicated**: Further debugging and refinement of `TubeMapVisualization.js`'s rendering routines, specifically for how it handles `activeCargoes` and `cargo` properties for `type: "individual"` events within the Port Qasim timeline, would be necessary. This would ensure the visual output accurately matches the detailed event data in `dataToUse.md` and `cargoData.js`. No direct code changes were applied by the AI to `TubeMapVisualization.js` in this immediate exchange for the Port Qasim visual discrepancy, as the immediate focus was on validating data correctness and understanding the scope of the visualization challenge.

### Session 2024-05-29: Refining Cargo vs. Tank Display Logic and Port Qasim Data Accuracy

This session focused on correcting the display logic for cargo operations in the main tube map visualization versus the tank-specific display in the cargo status modal. It also involved adding detailed operational data for Port Qasim.

#### 1. Clarifying Visualization Requirements & Port Qasim Data

*   **Initial Problem Statement (User)**:
    *   The main tube map visualization for Port Qasim did not show Unilever cargo operations, despite data suggesting they occurred.
    *   Some cargo lines in the tube map appeared straight, incorrectly suggesting no operations.
    *   The tube map was not clearly showing operations at the individual tank level for split cargoes.
    *   **Correction**: Unilever operations at Port Qasim for SOF8 (Palm Stearin, tanks 5S & 6P) were *discharge* operations, not loading.

*   **Data Updates for Port Qasim (Unilever - Stearin Discharge)**:
    *   To address the missing Unilever operations at Port Qasim, the `cargoTypes` in `src/data/cargoData.js` were updated for `CARGO2_5S` and `CARGO2_6P` (Stearin) to list Port Qasim as a discharge port:
        ```javascript
        // src/data/cargoData.js - Snippet for CARGO2_5S
        CARGO2_5S: { 
          name: "Stearin", 
          // ... other properties ...
          ports: ["Kuala Tanjung", "Port Qasim"], // Added Port Qasim
          loadPort: "Kuala Tanjung",
          dischargePort: "Port Qasim", // Changed from N/A
          dischargePortCode: "PKPQM", // Changed from N/A
          // ... other properties ...
        },
        // Similar change for CARGO2_6P
        ```
    *   Detailed timeline events for Unilever's Stearin (CARGO2) discharge at Port Qasim were added to `portOperations["Port Qasim"].timeline` in `src/data/cargoData.js`. This involved adding events like "5S,6P Hose Connected (UNILEVER)", "5S,6P Discharging Commenced (UNILEVER)", Squeegeeing, and "5S,6P Operations Complete (UNILEVER)".
        ```javascript
        // src/data/cargoData.js - Snippet from Port Qasim timeline
        {
          time: "17 May 12:45",
          event: "5S,6P Hose Connected (UNILEVER)",
          type: "individual",
          timeType: "laytime",
          activeCargoes: ["CARGO2"],
          cargo: "CARGO2",
          duration: "30m"
        },
        {
          time: "17 May 13:15",
          event: "5S,6P Discharging Commenced (UNILEVER)",
          type: "individual",
          timeType: "laytime",
          activeCargoes: ["CARGO2"],
          cargo: "CARGO2",
          duration: "8h 15m"
        },
        ```

#### 2. Refining Tube Map: Cargo Lines vs. Tank Mentions

*   **User Clarification**: The main tube map visualization should display lines representing **cargoes** (one line per cargo, e.g., "Fatty Acid"), not individual tanks. However, the event text associated with these cargo lines should mention the specific tanks involved (e.g., "5P,7W Loading Commenced"). The separate "Cargo Tanks" modal at the bottom is responsible for the detailed tank-by-tank breakdown.

*   **Data Structure Consolidation (`src/data/cargoData.js`)**: 
    *   The `cargoTypes` object was refactored. Instead of having separate entries for each tank (e.g., `CARGO1_5P`, `CARGO1_7W`), it was consolidated to have one entry per cargo parcel (e.g., `CARGO1`). This new cargo entry then included a `tanks` array (e.g., `["5P", "7W"]`) and a `tankDesignation` string (e.g., `"5P,7W"`).
        ```javascript
        // src/data/cargoData.js - OLD Structure Snippet
        // CARGO1_5P: { name: "Fatty Acid", cargoHold: "5P", ... },
        // CARGO1_7W: { name: "Fatty Acid", cargoHold: "7W", ... },

        // src/data/cargoData.js - NEW Structure Snippet
        CARGO1: { 
          name: "Fatty Acid", 
          // ... other properties ...
          tanks: ["5P", "7W"], 
          tankDesignation: "5P,7W"
        },
        CARGO2: { 
          name: "Stearin", 
          // ... other properties ...
          tanks: ["5S", "6P"], 
          tankDesignation: "5S,6P"
        },
        // OTHER charterer cargoes were also updated to include a `tanks` array.
        ```
    *   Consequently, `activeCargoes` and `cargo` fields within the `portOperations` timeline events were updated to use these new consolidated cargo IDs (e.g., `activeCargoes: ["CARGO1"]`, `cargo: "CARGO1"`).
    *   Ensured that shared events at Kuala Tanjung correctly listed both `CARGO1` and `CARGO2` in `activeCargoes` where applicable.

*   **Visualization Logic Adjustment (`src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js`)**: 
    *   The `replaceSOFWithCargoHold` function was identified as needing an update to use `tankDesignation` from the new `cargoTypes` structure, as `cargoHold` was no longer the primary field for this combined display. *(Self-correction: While I identified this, the user's subsequent file updates likely incorporated this or a similar fix, as the problem was about displaying tank names in event descriptions, which `tankDesignation` provides.)*

#### 3. Correcting the "Cargo Tanks" Modal (Individual Tank Display)

*   **Problem (User)**: The "Cargo Tanks" modal (rendered by `src/components/CargoStatusModal.js`) was incorrectly displaying the consolidated cargoes from `cargoTypes` instead of showing each individual tank as a separate card, which was its intended purpose.

*   **Solution Implemented**: 
    1.  **New Data Structure for Tanks (`src/data/cargoData.js`)**: 
        *   A new exported constant `tankData` was created. This object mirrors the structure of the old tank-specific `cargoTypes` but is explicitly for the tank modal. Each entry represents an individual tank (e.g., `TANK_5P`, `TANK_7W`) and includes a `parentCargo` field to link back to the consolidated cargo ID if needed.
            ```javascript
            // src/data/cargoData.js - Snippet for tankData
            export const tankData = {
              TANK_5P: { 
                name: "Fatty Acid", 
                charterer: "UNILEVER", 
                color: "#e91e63",
                // ... other properties ...
                cargoHold: "5P", 
                tankDesignation: "5P",
                parentCargo: "CARGO1"
              },
              // ... other tanks ...
            };
            ```
    2.  **Passing `tankData` to Modal (`src/App.js`)**: 
        *   `App.js` was updated to import `tankData`.
        *   `tankData` is now passed as the `cargoTypes` prop to the `CargoStatusModal` component. (Note: The prop name `cargoTypes` was kept for the modal, but it now receives `tankData`).
            ```javascript
            // src/App.js - Snippet
            import { vesselInfo, cargoTypes, tankData, /* ... */ } from './data/cargoData';
            // ...
            <CargoStatusModal 
              vesselInfo={vesselInfo}
              cargoTypes={tankData} // Changed from cargoTypes
              // ... other props ...
            />
            ```
    3.  **Updating Logic in `CargoStatusModal.js`**: 
        *   The functions `getUnileverCargoCount`, `getTotalCargoCount`, and `getOtherCargoCount` were revised to iterate over `currentCargoes` (which is populated from the passed `tankData`) and count individual tanks correctly.
            ```javascript
            // src/components/CargoStatusModal.js - Snippet
            const getUnileverCargoCount = () => {
              const unileverTanks = Object.values(currentCargoes).filter(cargo => cargo.charterer === 'UNILEVER');
              return unileverTanks.length;
            };
            const getOtherCargoCount = () => {
              const otherTanks = Object.values(currentCargoes).filter(cargo => cargo.charterer !== 'UNILEVER');
              return otherTanks.length;
            };
            ```
        *   The title attribute of the Unilever cargo count badge was updated to reflect "Unilever tanks".
        *   The display text for the badge was changed from "Cargoes" to "Tanks".
            ```javascript
            // src/components/CargoStatusModal.js - Badge Snippet
            <div className="info-badge cargo-count-badge" title={`${unileverCargoCount} Unilever tanks`}>
              {unileverCargoCount} {compressionLevel >= 3 ? 'T' : 'Tanks'}
            </div>
            ```

#### 4. User-Implemented Data Enhancements for Port Qasim & Tank Quantities

During this process, the user made direct modifications to `src/data/cargoData.js` which were integrated into the solution context:

*   **Detailed "OTHER" Charterer Operations at Port Qasim**: The user added numerous individual timeline events for the discharge operations of "OTHER" charterer cargoes (`OTHER_4S`, `OTHER_6S`, `OTHER_8W`, `OTHER_9W`) at Port Qasim. This involved specifying individual "Discharging Commenced" and "Operations Complete" events for each of these tanks.
*   **Tank Quantity Adjustments**: The `quantity` field within the new `tankData` structure (and the original tank-specific entries before `tankData` was created) was updated by the user to reflect per-tank quantities rather than the total quantity for the parent cargo parcel. For example, if "Fatty Acid" (CARGO1) had a total of 5,001.866 MT split between TANK_5P and TANK_7W, each tank entry was updated to show approximately half of that total (e.g., 2,500.933 MT).

These user changes significantly increased the granularity of the Port Qasim operational data, which the visualization components then needed to render accurately. The main tube map would show the consolidated "OTHER" cargo lines, while the "Cargo Tanks" modal would detail each of these "OTHER" tanks with their specific quantities.

### Session 2024-05-29 (Continued) - Multi-Charterer Operations & Visualization Accuracy at Port Qasim

This session focused on ensuring that cargo operations for multiple charterers, particularly at Port Qasim, are accurately displayed in the tube map visualization. Key requirements included showing all active cargoes, ensuring their lines branch out for the entire duration of their operations, and correctly reflecting individual completion times.

#### 1. Displaying All Charterer Operations at Port Qasim

*   **Feature Request**: The user highlighted that the visualization for Port Qasim needed to show operations for "OTHER" charterers alongside Unilever's, similar to a provided reference image. Initially, "OTHER" charterer cargoes (4S, 6S, 8W, 9W) were not appearing or not branching correctly.
*   **Problem Overcome**: 
    *   The initial issue was that "OTHER" charterer cargoes were only listed in `activeCargoes` for a single "Other Charterer Operations Start" event. This was insufficient for the visualization logic to treat them as ongoing operations that should branch out.
    *   There was an accidental deletion of Unilever-specific events (like hose connection) when adding "OTHER" charterer events.
*   **Solution Implemented**:
    1.  **Added Individual "Commenced" Events for OTHER Cargoes**: To ensure each "OTHER" charterer cargo had a clear operational window, individual "Discharging Commenced" events were added for `OTHER_4S`, `OTHER_6S`, `OTHER_8W`, and `OTHER_9W` in `src/data/cargoData.js`.
        ```javascript
        // src/data/cargoData.js - Port Qasim Timeline Snippet (Illustrative)
        {
          time: "17 May 07:35",
          event: "Other Charterer Operations Start",
          type: "shared",
          timeType: "non-unilever",
          activeCargoes: ["OTHER_4S", "OTHER_6S", "OTHER_8W", "OTHER_9W"],
          duration: "5h 10m"
        },
        {
          time: "17 May 07:35",
          event: "4S Discharging Commenced",
          type: "individual",
          timeType: "non-unilever",
          activeCargoes: ["OTHER_4S", "OTHER_6S", "OTHER_8W", "OTHER_9W"], // Ensured all concurrent OTHER cargoes are listed
          cargo: "OTHER_4S",
          duration: "5h 10m" // Or individual duration if known
        },
        // ... similar entries for OTHER_6S, OTHER_8W, OTHER_9W ...
        ```
    2.  **Restored Unilever Events**: Corrected the timeline to re-include Unilever's "5S,6P Hose Connected (UNILEVER)" and "5S,6P Discharging Commenced (UNILEVER)" events at their correct times.
        ```javascript
        // src/data/cargoData.js - Port Qasim Timeline Snippet
        {
          time: "17 May 12:45",
          event: "5S,6P Hose Connected (UNILEVER)",
          type: "individual",
          timeType: "laytime",
          activeCargoes: ["CARGO2"],
          cargo: "CARGO2",
          duration: "30m"
        },
        {
          time: "17 May 13:15",
          event: "5S,6P Discharging Commenced (UNILEVER)",
          type: "individual",
          timeType: "laytime",
          activeCargoes: ["CARGO2"],
          cargo: "CARGO2",
          duration: "8h 15m"
        },
        ```

#### 2. Ensuring Cargo Lines Stay Branched for Entire Operation Duration

*   **Feature Request**: Cargo lines, once branched for an operation, must remain branched until that specific cargo's operation is complete. They should not rejoin the centerline prematurely.
*   **Problem Overcome**: The `isInOperationsPhase` function in `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js` initially had logic that might cause "OTHER" charterer cargoes to rejoin the center line based on a single shared "Other Charterer Operations Complete" event, rather than their individual completion events.
*   **Solution Implemented**:
    1.  **Added Individual "Operations Complete" Events for OTHER Cargoes**: To enable individual return-to-center behavior, distinct "Operations Complete" events were added for each "OTHER" charterer cargo in `src/data/cargoData.js`, each with its own completion time.
        ```javascript
        // src/data/cargoData.js - Port Qasim Timeline Snippet (Illustrative)
        {
          time: "17 May 08:45", // Example completion time for 4S
          event: "4S Operations Complete",
          type: "individual",
          timeType: "non-unilever",
          activeCargoes: ["OTHER_6S", "OTHER_8W", "OTHER_9W"], // Remaining active OTHER cargoes
          cargo: "OTHER_4S",
          duration: "0m"
        },
        // ... similar individual completion entries for OTHER_6S, OTHER_8W, OTHER_9W ...
        {
          time: "17 May 12:45", // Original shared event, now more of an admin marker
          event: "Other Charterer Operations Complete",
          type: "shared",
          timeType: "non-unilever",
          activeCargoes: [], // Or only those still active if any, now none as all have individual completions
          duration: "0m"
        },
        ```
    2.  **Refined `isInOperationsPhase` Logic**: The `isInOperationsPhase` function in `src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js` was updated to correctly identify the operational window for each cargo (including "OTHER" charterer ones) by looking for its specific start and *individual* completion events.
The special handling for `cargoId.startsWith('OTHER_')` looking for the shared complete event was removed, ensuring it uses the individual complete events added in the data.
        ```javascript
        // src/components/TubeMapVisualization.js - isInOperationsPhase Snippet
        // ... (Look for operation start events as before) ...

        // Look for operation end events  
        for (let i = portData.timeline.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          const e = portData.timeline[i];
          
          // Look for individual complete events for all cargoes
          if (e.cargo === cargoId && (
            e.event.includes('Operations Complete') ||
            e.event.includes('Operations Completed') ||
            e.event.includes('Loading Complete') ||
            e.event.includes('Discharge Complete') ||
            e.event.includes('Discharging Complete')
          )) {
            operationsEnd = i;
            break;
          }
        }
        
        if (operationsStart !== null && operationsEnd !== null) {
          return eventIndex >= operationsStart && eventIndex <= operationsEnd;
        }
        // ... (fallback logic as before) ...
        ```

#### 3. Development Environment and Workflow

*   **Running on Specific Port**: Successfully ran the React application on `localhost:3003` using the command `PORT=3003 npm start` when port `3000` was occupied.
*   **Code Checkpoints**: Created a versioned backup (checkpoint `v3_20250525_171412`) of the `src/`, `public/`, and `package*.json` files to allow for easy rollbacks. This was done using `mkdir` and `cp` commands via the terminal.
    ```bash
    # Example commands used for checkpointing
    mkdir -p backup/v3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    cp -r src backup/v3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
    cp -r public backup/v3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
    cp package*.json backup/v3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
    # An info file was also created in the backup directory
    ```

This session resulted in a more accurate and detailed visualization of cargo operations at Port Qasim, correctly reflecting concurrent operations by multiple charterers and ensuring that each cargo's operational timeline is distinctly represented from start to its individual completion. The development process involved iterative refinement of both the data in `cargoData.js` and the rendering logic in `TubeMapVisualization.js`.

## Session 2024-05-30: Right Sidebar PortAnalysisPanel & Scroll Synchronization

This session focused on creating a dynamic right sidebar panel (`PortAnalysisPanel`) to display detailed information about the currently focused or viewed port, and then enhancing it to synchronize with the user's scroll position in the main tube map visualization.

### 1. Initial Feature Request: Enhanced Right Sidebar - Port-Specific Data

*   **User Request**: Implement a right sidebar that shows port-specific data. The display should adapt based on whether the selected port is a multi-charterer port (like Port Qasim) or a single-charterer port (like Kuala Tanjung, Kandla).
    *   **Multi-Charterer View (e.g., Port Qasim)**: Should display a warning, cargo split percentages, detailed Unilever calculation (Gross Window, Deductions, Net Time), and validation status.
    *   **Single-Charterer View**: Simpler display with Laytime Used, basic breakdown, and status.
    *   The system should analyze the existing code and propose an implementation plan.

### 2. Implementation Plan and Initial `PortAnalysisPanel` Creation

*   **Proposed Solution**: 
    1.  Create a new component `src/components/PortAnalysisPanel.js`.
    2.  Define a data structure (e.g., in `cargoData.js` or a new file) to hold the specific analysis details for each port.
    3.  Integrate this panel into the main layout, passing `activePort` and the new analysis data as props.
    4.  The panel would then render different UIs based on the `activePort`'s characteristics (multi-charterer vs. single-charterer).

*   **Initial Implementation**: 
    *   Created `PortAnalysisPanel.js` to receive `activePort`, `portOperations`, and `timeTracking` props.
    *   Added conditional rendering logic based on `activePort` and hardcoded data for Port Qasim's multi-charterer view and a generic single-charterer view.
    *   Created `PortAnalysisPanel.css` for styling.
    *   Integrated into `src/App.js`:
        ```javascript
        // In App.js
        import PortAnalysisPanel from './components/PortAnalysisPanel';
        // ...
        <PortAnalysisPanel
          activePort={activePort} // Later changed to displayPort
          portOperations={portOperations}
          timeTracking={timeTracking}
        />
        ```
    *   The panel updated based on the `activePort` state, which was controlled by user clicks in the `ControlPanel`.

### 3. Scroll-Based Updates for `PortAnalysisPanel`

*   **User Request**: Enhance the `PortAnalysisPanel` so that it automatically updates to show data for the port currently visible in the main `TubeMapVisualization` as the user scrolls, especially when "All Ports" are displayed.

*   **Implementation Steps**: 
    1.  **Scroll Detection in `TubeMapVisualization.js`**:
        *   Added a new prop `onPortInView` (callback function) to `TubeMapVisualization`.
        *   Stored Y-positions (`startY`, `endY`, `midY`) of each port in a `portPositions` state variable when `processPortData` runs.
        *   Added a `useEffect` hook to listen for `scroll` events (on both `window` and the visualization container itself).
        *   The scroll handler calculates the center of the viewport and determines which port's `midY` is closest to this center.
        *   Called `onPortInView(closestPort)` with the name of the detected port.
        *   Initial implementation used `window.scrollY`. This was later refined.
            ```javascript
            // Simplified scroll detection logic in TubeMapVisualization.js
            useEffect(() => {
              if (!onPortInView || activePort !== 'all') return;

              const handleScroll = () => {
                const container = svgRef.current?.parentElement;
                if (!container) return;
                const containerRect = container.getBoundingClientRect();
                const containerScrollTop = container.scrollTop;
                const viewportCenter = containerScrollTop + (containerRect.height / 2);
                
                let closestPort = null;
                let closestDistance = Infinity;
                Object.entries(portPositions).forEach(([portName, position]) => {
                  const distance = Math.abs(position.midY - viewportCenter);
                  if (distance < closestDistance) { /* ... update closestPort ... */ }
                });
                if (closestPort) onPortInView(closestPort);
              };
              // ... (event listener setup with debouncing) ...
            }, [portPositions, onPortInView, activePort]);
            ```

    2.  **State Management in `App.js`**:
        *   Added `portInView` state variable.
        *   Added `handlePortInView` function to update this state.
        *   Passed `onPortInView={handlePortInView}` to `TubeMapVisualization`.
        *   Modified `PortAnalysisPanel` to receive a `displayPort` prop, which would be `activePort` if a specific port was selected, or `portInView` otherwise.
            ```javascript
            // In App.js
            const [portInView, setPortInView] = useState(null);
            const handlePortInView = (port) => setPortInView(port);
            const displayPort = activePort !== 'all' ? activePort : portInView;
            // ...
            <TubeMapVisualization onPortInView={handlePortInView} /* ... */ />
            <PortAnalysisPanel activePort={displayPort} /* ... */ />
            ```

    3.  **Visual Indicators in `PortAnalysisPanel.js`**:
        *   Added a hint text "Or scroll through the visualization" when no port is selected.
        *   Added a 📍 icon next to the port name in the panel if `scrollPosition === activePort` (initially used `scrollPosition` prop, later refactored).
        *   Added a temporary highlight animation (`.scroll-update` class with a blue border and scale effect) to visually indicate when the panel updates due to scrolling.

*   **Problems Overcome**: 
    *   **Scroll Detection Accuracy**: The initial scroll detection using only `window.scrollY` was not always accurate, especially if the visualization container itself was scrollable and not taking up the full window height. The logic was refined to use the `scrollTop` and dimensions of the `svgRef.current.parentElement` (the `.tube-map-container`).
    *   **Ensuring Correct Container for Scroll Events**: Ensured that scroll listeners were attached to both the `window` and the specific scrollable container of the visualization for more robust detection.

### 4. User-Implemented Major Refactor of `PortAnalysisPanel`

Following the implementation of scroll-based updates, the user performed a significant refactoring of the `PortAnalysisPanel.js` component and its associated CSS (`PortAnalysisPanel.css`). This effectively redesigned the panel.

*   **Observed Changes (via file diffs)**:
    *   **Component Structure and Props (`PortAnalysisPanel.js`)**:
        *   Props changed from `(activePort, portOperations, timeTracking, scrollPosition)` to `(activePort, activeCharterer, portInView)`.
        *   Internal state management changed: `isExpanded`, `isScrollUpdate` were replaced by `currentPort` and `expandedSections` (for collapsible UI sections).
        *   Logic for determining `currentPort` was updated to prioritize `activePort` (manual selection), then `portInView` (scroll-based), then a default port.
        ```javascript
        // Snippet from user-refactored PortAnalysisPanel.js
        useEffect(() => {
          if (activePort && activePort !== 'all') {
            setCurrentPort(activePort);
          } else if (portInView && portInView !== 'all') {
            setCurrentPort(portInView);
          } else {
            const firstPort = Object.keys(portOperations)[0];
            setCurrentPort(firstPort);
          }
        }, [activePort, portInView]);
        ```
    *   **UI Design (`PortAnalysisPanel.js` and `PortAnalysisPanel.css`)**: 
        *   The panel was redesigned with a main header (showing "Port Analysis" and a sync status icon: 📍 for scroll-sync, 🎯 for fixed view).
        *   A prominent display for the `currentPort` name, country, and berth was added.
        *   Implemented collapsible sections: "Port Overview", "Time Analysis", "Cargo Operations", and "Proration Analysis" (conditional).
        *   Each section has a header with an icon and a toggle (+/-).
    *   **Data Processing and Display (`PortAnalysisPanel.js`)**:
        *   New helper functions `calculateTimeStats`, `parseDuration`, `formatMinutes` were added to process and display time data from `portData.timeline`.
        *   Logic to filter `cargoTypes` for the `currentPort` and categorize them by charterer (Unilever/OTHER).
        *   The "Port Overview" section shows total events, charterer type, cargo count, and port type.
        *   The "Time Analysis" section displays Waiting Time, Laytime Used, Deductions, Other Charterer Time, and specific laytime calculation details if present in `portData.laytimeCalculation`.
        *   The "Cargo Operations" section lists Unilever and OTHER cargoes with their names, tank designations, quantities, and operation type (Loading/Discharging).
        *   The "Proration Analysis" section appears for multi-charterer ports, explaining the proration methodology.
        *   Transit information (`transitToNext`) is displayed at the bottom.
    *   **CSS Overhaul (`PortAnalysisPanel.css`)**: Extensive changes were made to style the new panel structure, including flexbox layouts, sticky headers, section styling, grid layouts for overview items, and custom scrollbars.
    *   **`TubeMapVisualization.js` Change by User**: Added `data-port={portName}` attribute to the port group `g` elements, likely intended to assist with more precise scroll detection or direct DOM interaction if needed (though the primary scroll detection still relied on calculated Y-positions).

*   **Impact**: This user-driven refactor significantly changed the appearance, structure, and data presentation of the `PortAnalysisPanel`, moving it towards a more detailed and modular design. The core functionality of updating based on `activePort` (manual selection) or `portInView` (scroll selection) was preserved and adapted to the new structure.

This covers the key developments for the `PortAnalysisPanel`. The collaboration involved initial AI-led implementation of the basic panel and scroll sync, followed by a substantial user-led redesign and feature enhancement of the panel itself.

Okay, I will append a new section to your `developmentlog.md` file detailing the UI refinements for compactness and the introduction of floating port modals.

## Session 2024-05-30 (Afternoon): UI Compactness and Floating Port Modals

This session focused on two main areas: making the UI elements (Cargo Status Modal, Control Panel) more compact to increase data density, and a significant architectural shift from a single right sidebar panel to individual floating modals for each port, triggered by user scroll and focus.

### 1. UI Compactness Refinements

*   **Feature Request**: The user requested that the `CargoStatusModal` (top header) and the `ControlPanel` (right sidebar controls) be made smaller, with reduced font sizes, padding, and icon sizes, to allow more data to be visible in a constrained area. The main visualization area's sizing was deemed appropriate.

*   **Problem Overcome**: The existing UI, while functional, used relatively large fonts and padding, which limited the amount of information that could be displayed without scrolling, especially on smaller screens or when multiple panels were open.

*   **Solution Implemented (CSS Modifications)**:
    *   **`CargoStatusModal.css` (`src/components/CargoStatusModal.css`)**:
        *   Reduced overall padding, border-radius, and minimum height of the modal.
        *   Decreased font sizes for vessel titles, route text, and badge text.
        *   Shrank padding and border-radius for info badges.
        *   Made cargo section headers and titles smaller.
        *   Reduced gaps and padding in the cargo grid and individual cargo items.
        *   Scaled down scroll navigation buttons and their icons.
        *   Adjusted various font sizes and margins throughout the voyage summary section within the modal to be more compact.
        *   **Example Snippet (Illustrative of changes in `CargoStatusModal.css`)**:
            ```css
            /* Original .vessel-title */
            /* font-size: 24px; */

            /* New .vessel-title */
            font-size: 18px; /* Reduced from 24px */

            /* Original .info-badge */
            /* padding: 7px 14px; font-size: 14px; */

            /* New .info-badge */
            padding: 4px 10px; /* Reduced */
            font-size: 11px; /* Reduced */
            ```

    *   **`CollapsibleControlModal.css` (`src/components/CollapsibleControlModal.css`) for Control Panel**:
        *   Reduced padding and border-radius for the `.collapsible-control-modal` and `.modal-header`.
        *   Decreased font size for `.modal-title`.
        *   Reduced padding, border-radius, and font sizes for `.control-section h3` and generic `.btn` styles within the modal.
        *   Adjusted gaps for `.btn-group`.
        *   **Example Snippet (Illustrative of changes in `CollapsibleControlModal.css`)**:
            ```css
            /* Original .modal-title */
            /* font-size: 1.4rem; */

            /* New .modal-title */
            font-size: 1.2rem; /* Reduced */

            /* Original .btn */
            /* padding: 10px 16px; font-size: 0.9rem; */

            /* New .btn */
            padding: 8px 12px;
            font-size: 0.8rem;
            ```

    *   **`App.css` (`src/App.css`)**:
        *   The main app padding was adjusted to `0` as the new layout uses padding within `.main-layout`.
        *   The `.main-layout` now has `padding: 16px;` but `padding-top: 0;` to account for the sticky `CargoStatusModal`.
        *   The `.right-sidebar` width was adjusted (e.g., default 320px, responsive down to 260px before stacking).
        *   Spacing for `.app.modal-sticky .main-layout` was added to prevent content overlap when the cargo modal is sticky.

### 2. Architectural Shift: Introduction of Floating Port Modals & Sidebar Refactor

This was a major change initiated by the user through direct modifications to `src/App.js`, `src/App.css`, and component files. The previous single `PortAnalysisPanel` in the right sidebar was replaced by a system of individual `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` components, and the right sidebar's role was adjusted to primarily host general control elements.

*   **User-Implemented Changes (Observed in `src/App.js`, `src/App.css`, and component files)**:
    1.  **Component Reorganization**:
        *   The previous `PortAnalysisPanel` was effectively removed. The functionality for displaying detailed port-specific data was moved into `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.js`.
        *   The `CollapsibleControlModal.js` (general controls) and `TimeTrackingPanel.js` (voyage-wide time analysis) remained as the primary components within the right sidebar.
    2.  **New Layout Structure in `App.js` and `App.css`**:
        *   The main layout in `App.js` was structured with a top `CargoStatusModal`, then a `.main-layout` div containing a `.visualization-area` (for the tube map and floating panels) and a `.right-sidebar` (for the control modal and time tracking panel).
        *   **`App.css`**: Styles were updated to support this flex layout. `.visualization-area` takes `flex: 1`, and `.right-sidebar` has a fixed width (e.g., 320px, responsive).
            ```javascript
            // App.js structure snippet
            <div className="app">
              <CargoStatusModal ... />
              <div className="main-layout">
                <div className="visualization-area">
                  <TubeMapVisualization ... />
                  <FloatingPanelsContainer ... /> 
                </div>
                <div className="right-sidebar">
                  <CollapsibleControlModal ... />
                  <TimeTrackingPanel ... />
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            ```
        *   The user further refined `App.css`, creating a `.sidebar-area` which seems to wrap the `.right-sidebar` to manage its overflow and height more explicitly, and made the `.right-sidebar` height `fit-content` to dynamically adjust to its children.

    3.  **`FloatingPanelsContainer.js` (User Deletion & Re-creation Approach)**:
        *   The file `FloatingPanelsContainer.js` was deleted and then effectively re-implemented with refined logic by the AI (in subsequent steps) to manage the positioning and visibility of the `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` instances.
        *   The core idea remained: this container would calculate positions for each port panel relative to the SVG elements in the `TubeMapVisualization` and manage their scroll-tracking behavior.

    4.  **`FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.js` (User Refactor)**:
        *   The props were changed from `(portName, portData, portCargoes, position, isVisible, ...)` to `(port, data, cargoTypes, isExpanded, onToggle, isHighlighted, ...)`. This indicates a shift in how expansion and data are handled.
        *   The panel no longer uses internal tabs; instead, it displays a comprehensive view of overview, timing, and cargo details when expanded.
        *   Proration calculation logic (`calculateProration`) was added directly into this component.
        *   The `onClick` for the panel header now calls the `onToggle` prop, suggesting expansion is managed by the parent.

*   **Problems Addressed by Combined AI and User Refactoring**: 
    *   **Scalability and Context**: The single `PortAnalysisPanel` could become very long. Individual floating modals allow for more focused, less cluttered display directly associated with the visual port element.
    *   **Layout Clarity**: The new `main-layout` structure with a distinct `visualization-area` and `right-sidebar` provides a clearer separation of concerns.
    *   **Positioning and Scroll Tracking for Floating Panels**: This was a key challenge. The `FloatingPanelsContainer` was refined (by AI, after user changes to the panel itself) to:
        *   Query the DOM for SVG elements (`g.port-group[data-port="..."]` or `text.port-title`) to find the correct anchor points for each port.
        *   Calculate panel positions relative to the `.visualization-area` and account for its scroll position.
        *   Use `requestAnimationFrame` (implicitly, via browser handling of scroll events) and `setTimeout` to ensure calculations happen after DOM updates.
        *   Attach scroll listeners to the `.visualization-area` and resize listeners to the window.
        *   The panel visibility is controlled by `activePort` (if a specific port is focused) or shows all panels if `activePort` is 'all'.

*   **Outcome**: The UI is significantly more dynamic. The right sidebar hosts general controls and voyage-wide time analysis, both collapsible. Detailed port-specific information, including laytime and proration, is presented in floating panels that appear contextually next to their respective ports in the main visualization and track with user scrolling. This offers a more direct and potentially less overwhelming way to access detailed data. The development involved significant user-driven architectural changes, particularly to the floating panel component and the main app layout, with AI assisting in refining the positioning logic for these floating elements and CSS adjustments.

*   **Final Adjustments for Floating Panel Functionality (AI)**:
    *   Ensured `FloatingPanelsContainer.js` correctly queries `g.port-group[data-port="${portName}"]` within the `.tube-map-svg` for positioning.
    *   The `useEffect` in `FloatingPanelsContainer.js` was modified to have a more robust calculation attempt loop using `setTimeout` to handle cases where SVG elements might not be immediately available.
    *   The `visualization-area` CSS class was given `position: relative;` to be the correct positioning context for the absolutely positioned floating panels.
    *   The `FloatingPanelsContainer` itself was styled to be an absolutely positioned overlay within `visualization-area` to ensure its children (the panels) are positioned relative to the visualization, not the document flow.
    *   The `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` was given `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to ensure it remains interactive.
    *   Added `enhancePortData` within `FloatingPanelsContainer` to calculate and inject laytime and proration data into each `portData` object before passing it to the `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel`.

### Session 2024-05-31: Individual Floating Port Modals and Cargo Quantity Corrections

This session involved a significant architectural change, moving from a consolidated port details panel in the right sidebar to individual floating modals for each port. It also included a data correction to split Unilever cargo quantities evenly among their respective tanks.

#### 1. Architectural Shift: Right Sidebar to Individual Floating Port Modals

*   **User Request (Implied by Query)**: The user expressed that the previous approach of showing all port details within the right sidebar was too restrictive. They needed individual modals for each port (Kuala Tanjung, Kandla, Port Qasim) that could:
    *   Float at the same level as the right sidebar (not inside it).
    *   Position themselves beneath/next to the existing right sidebar.
    *   Align with and track their corresponding port location in the tube map visualization.
    *   This would allow the modals to be responsive to their port's position in the tube map.

*   **Problem Overcome**: The previous design, with a single panel in the sidebar, limited the contextual display of port-specific information. When viewing all ports, it was difficult to associate the detailed data with the correct visual representation in the tube map. The new architecture aimed to provide a more direct and visually linked way to access port details.

*   **Solution Implemented**:
    1.  **Removal of `FloatingPanelsContainer` from Right Sidebar (`src/App.js`)**:
        *   The `FloatingPanelsContainer` component, which previously managed panels within the right sidebar, was removed from its position within the `.right-sidebar` div.
        ```javascript
        // src/App.js - Snippet of change
        // ... inside .right-sidebar div
        <TimeTrackingPanel ... />
        {/* <FloatingPanelsContainer ... /> */}
        // ...
        ```

    2.  **Introduction of `FloatingPortModal` Component (`src/components/FloatingPortModal.js` and `src/components/FloatingPortModal.css`)**:
        *   A new component `FloatingPortModal.js` was created. Each instance of this component would represent one port.
        *   **Props**: It accepts `port`, `data` (port-specific operations), `cargoTypes`, `activePort`, `activeCharterer`, `greyOutNonUnilever`, `portInView`, and `isVisible`.
        *   **Internal Logic**:
            *   Uses `useState` for `isExpanded` (defaulting to `true`) and `position` (top/left coordinates).
            *   Uses `useRef` for `modalRef` (to reference the modal's DOM element) and `animationFrameRef`.
            *   **Positioning Logic (`useEffect` hook)**:
                *   Calculates `left` position to align with the left edge of the `.right-sidebar`.
                *   Calculates `top` position to align with the vertical center of the corresponding port element (`g[data-port="${port}"]`) in the `.visualization-area`.
                *   Includes logic to check for overlaps with other `FloatingPortModal` instances and stacks them vertically with `minSpacing` if necessary.
                *   Ensures modals don't render above the viewport top.
                *   Attaches event listeners (`scroll` on `.visualization-area` and `window`, `resize` on `window`) to trigger `updatePosition` via `requestAnimationFrame`.
                *   Includes an interval (`setInterval`) to periodically refresh positions as a fallback.
        *   **Styling (`FloatingPortModal.css`)**:
            *   `position: fixed` for true floating behavior.
            *   `width` matching the sidebar (e.g., 380px, with responsive adjustments).
            *   `z-index` management to bring highlighted modals to the front.
            *   Styling for a `.highlighted` state (e.g., border, shadow, scale transform) when `portInView === port`.
            *   A `slideIn` animation for appearance.
        *   It renders a `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` component internally to display the actual port content.

    3.  **Integration into `App.js`**:
        *   `FloatingPortModal` is imported.
        *   Instances are created by mapping over `Object.entries(portOperations)` at the top level of the `App` component's return statement, outside the `.main-layout` div.
        ```javascript
        // src/App.js - Snippet
        // ... (imports) ...
        import FloatingPortModal from './components/FloatingPortModal';

        function App() {
          // ... (state and handlers) ...
          return (
            <div className="app">
              <CargoStatusModal ... />
              <div className="main-layout">
                {/* ... visualization-area and right-sidebar ... */}
              </div>

              {/* Individual Port Floating Modals - Outside main layout */}
              {Object.entries(portOperations).map(([port, data]) => (
                <FloatingPortModal
                  key={port}
                  port={port}
                  data={data}
                  cargoTypes={cargoTypes}
                  activePort={activePort}
                  activeCharterer={activeCharterer}
                  greyOutNonUnilever={greyOutNonUnilever}
                  portInView={portInView}
                  isVisible={activePort === 'all' || activePort === port} // Show if all ports view or specific port selected
                />
              ))}
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```

    4.  **Cleanup**: 
        *   The old `FloatingPanelsContainer.js` and `FloatingPanelsContainer.css` files were deleted as they were superseded by the new `FloatingPortModal` architecture.
        *   The import for `FloatingPanelsContainer` was removed from `App.js`.
        *   CSS in `App.css` related to `.right-sidebar > div:last-child` (which was for the old container) was deemed no longer necessary due to the architectural change.

#### 2. Splitting Cargo Amounts Evenly Between Tanks

*   **User Request**: For UNILEVER cargoes (Fatty Acid and Stearin) that are carried in multiple tanks, the total cargo amount should be evenly divided and displayed for each tank in the `tankData` structure.

*   **Problem Overcome**: The `tankData` previously showed the *total* parcel quantity for each tank, rather than the portion specific to that tank. This misrepresented the individual tank loadings.

*   **Solution Implemented (`src/data/cargoData.js`)**: 
    *   The `quantity` field for the relevant UNILEVER tanks in the `tankData` object was manually updated to reflect an even split of the parent cargo's total quantity.
    *   **Fatty Acid (CARGO1, Total: 5,001.866 MT)**:
        *   `TANK_5P.quantity`: "2,500.933 MT"
        *   `TANK_7W.quantity`: "2,500.933 MT"
    *   **Stearin (CARGO2, Total: 3,003.315 MT)**:
        *   `TANK_5S.quantity`: "1,501.658 MT" (half, rounded up for precision)
        *   `TANK_6P.quantity`: "1,501.657 MT" (half, rounded down for precision)
    ```javascript
    // src/data/cargoData.js - Snippet from tankData update
    // Fatty Acid - Tank 5P
    TANK_5P: { 
      // ... other properties
      quantity: "2,500.933 MT", // Half of 5,001.866 MT
      // ...
    },
    // Fatty Acid - Tank 7W
    TANK_7W: { 
      // ... other properties
      quantity: "2,500.933 MT", // Half of 5,001.866 MT
      // ...
    },
    // Stearin - Tank 5S  
    TANK_5S: { 
      // ... other properties
      quantity: "1,501.658 MT", // Half of 3,003.315 MT (rounded up)
      // ...
    },
    // Stearin - Tank 6P
    TANK_6P: { 
      // ... other properties
      quantity: "1,501.657 MT", // Half of 3,003.315 MT (rounded down)
      // ...
    },
    ```

*   **Impact**: This data correction ensures that visualizations and data displays relying on `tankData` (like the cargo status modal and potentially parts of the port detail panels) show accurate per-tank quantities for these split UNILEVER cargoes.

This session marked a shift towards a more granular and contextually-aware display of port-specific information, moving complex details out of the main sidebar and into dedicated floating elements directly linked to the visualization.

Okay, I will append a new section to your `developmentlog.md` file detailing the recent UI refinements, the architectural shift to individual floating port modals, and the CSS changes for compactness and dynamic height.

## Session 2024-05-31 (Continued) - UI Refinements, Floating Modals, and Dynamic Sizing

This session continued with significant UI and architectural changes, focusing on making the port-specific information panels (FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel) more compact, ensuring they expand to their full content height, and refining their positioning logic to work as individual floating modals.

### 1. Making Floating Port Modals More Compact

*   **Feature Request**: The user, through direct CSS modifications, indicated a need for the `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` to be more compact, using smaller fonts, reduced padding, and tighter spacing to improve information density.

*   **Problem Overcome**: The previous styling of the panel, while functional, used more generous spacing. The user's changes aimed to fit more of the detailed port information into the panel, especially considering it now had to accommodate a comprehensive view without tabs.

*   **User-Implemented CSS Changes (`src/components/FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.css`)**:
    *   **Overall Panel**: Reduced `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `min-width`/`max-width` were adjusted to `width: 100%` (to fill its container, the `FloatingPortModal`).
    *   **Collapsed State**: Reduced `max-height` when collapsed (e.g., to `50px`).
    *   **Header**: Reduced `padding`, `border-radius`, icon/dot sizes, and font sizes for port name, operation type, and cargo count.
    *   **Content Area (`.panel-content.comprehensive-view`)**: Reduced `padding`. Changed `overflow-y: auto` to `overflow: visible` to allow natural height expansion.
    *   **Sections (`.section`, `.section-title`)**: Reduced margins, padding, and font sizes.
    *   **Overview Grid (`.stat-item`, `.stat-label`, `.stat-value`)**: Reduced gaps, padding, and font sizes.
    *   **Time Analysis (`.time-item`, `.time-label`, `.time-value`)**: Reduced padding, border thickness, and font sizes.
    *   **Laytime Calculation (`.laytime-calculation`, `h6`, `.calc-row`)**: Reduced padding, margins, and font sizes.
    *   **Cargo Details (`.cargo-group-title`, `.cargo-item`, `.cargo-header`, `.cargo-name`, `.cargo-quantity`)**: Reduced margins, padding, icon sizes, and font sizes.
    *   **Responsive Adjustments**: Minor tweaks to responsive styles for consistency.

    ```css
    /* Illustrative Snippet of User CSS Changes for Compactness */
    .floating-situational-panel {
      /* ... */
      width: 100%; /* Instead of fixed min/max */
    }

    .floating-situational-panel.expanded {
      max-height: none; /* Allow full expansion */
      height: auto;
    }

    .panel-header {
      padding: 8px 12px; /* Reduced from 12px 16px */
      /* ... other reductions ... */
    }

    .port-name {
      font-size: 13px; /* Reduced from 14px */
    }

    .panel-content.comprehensive-view {
      padding: 0 12px 12px 12px; /* Reduced */
      overflow: visible; /* Key change for height expansion */
    }

    .section-title {
      font-size: 12px; /* Reduced from 13px */
      /* ... other reductions ... */
    }
    /* ... many other similar reductions throughout the file ... */
    ```

### 2. Ensuring Floating Port Modals Expand to Full Content Height

*   **Feature Request**: The floating port modals (specifically the `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` they contain) should expand vertically to display all their content without internal scrollbars, or up to the browser viewport's limits if the content is very long.

*   **Problem Overcome**: The previous CSS for `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.expanded` and `.panel-content.comprehensive-view` had `max-height` restrictions that caused internal scrolling. The positioning logic in `FloatingPortModal.js` also used a fixed `modalHeight` estimate.

*   **Solution Implemented**:
    1.  **CSS Changes (`src/components/FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.css` - AI & User)**:
        *   The user's CSS changes (detailed above for compactness) already set `max-height: none;` and `height: auto;` for `.floating-situational-panel.expanded`, and `overflow: visible;` for `.panel-content.comprehensive-view`. These were key for allowing natural height expansion.
        *   **AI Refinement**: I confirmed these and further adjusted the `.floating-situational-panel.expanded` to `max-height: calc(100vh - 40px);` to ensure it doesn't overflow the viewport, while `height: auto;` lets it take what it needs up to that limit.
        *   The `.panel-content.comprehensive-view`'s `max-height` was set to `calc(100vh - 120px)` (to account for panel header and some margin) with `overflow-y: auto;` (to only show scrollbar if it *still* exceeds viewport after expansion). `flex: 1;` was added to encourage expansion.

        ```css
        /* src/components/FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel.css - Key AI-refined styles for expansion */
        .floating-situational-panel.expanded {
          max-height: calc(100vh - 40px); /* Expand to browser limits with 40px margin */
          height: auto; /* Allow natural height expansion */
        }

        .panel-header {
          /* ... */
          flex-shrink: 0; /* Prevent header from shrinking if panel uses flex internally */
        }

        .panel-content.comprehensive-view {
          padding: 0 16px 16px 16px; /* Restored some padding for readability */
          overflow-y: auto; /* Only show scrollbar if content exceeds viewport height */
          max-height: calc(100vh - 120px); /* Max content height considering panel header & margins */
          flex: 1; /* Allow content to expand if panel is flex container */
        }
        ```

    2.  **Dynamic Height in Positioning Logic (`src/components/FloatingPortModal.js` - AI)**:
        *   The `useEffect` hook in `FloatingPortModal.js` that calculates panel positions was modified to use the modal's *actual* current height (`modalRef.current.offsetHeight`) instead of a fixed estimate like `modalHeight = 400;`.
        *   The logic for checking overlaps and preventing bottom cutoff was updated to use this dynamic height, ensuring that even fully expanded panels are positioned correctly and don't go off-screen.
        *   The `maxModalHeight` used in collision detection was set to `viewportHeight - 40` (a dynamic value).

        ```javascript
        // src/components/FloatingPortModal.js - Snippet of positioning logic change
        // ... inside updatePosition ...
        const modalActualHeight = modalRef.current ? modalRef.current.offsetHeight : (viewportHeight - 40); // Use actual or max
        const maxModalHeight = viewportHeight - 40; // Still useful for stacking logic limits

        // When checking for overlaps with otherModals:
        // Use otherModal.getBoundingClientRect().height for otherActualHeight

        // When checking bottom cutoff:
        if (finalTop + modalActualHeight > viewportHeight - 20) { // Use modalActualHeight
          finalTop = Math.max(20, viewportHeight - modalActualHeight - 20); // Use modalActualHeight
        }
        ```
        *   The user had also been refining this positioning logic in `FloatingPortModal.js`, changing how `scrollTop` was determined (using `window.pageYOffset`), and the logic for `positionMode` ('fixed' vs 'absolute') based on viewport thresholds and port visibility. My changes aimed to integrate dynamic height considerations into this evolving positioning system.

*   **Outcome**: The floating port modals now correctly expand to show all their content. The internal scrollbar in the `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel` is gone unless the fully expanded panel *still* exceeds the viewport height. The positioning logic is more robust in handling these dynamically sized panels.

### 3. Removal of Port 3003 Requirement

*   **User Query Context**: The user previously had a `prorationDesign/front-end-port` instruction to run the front-end on `localhost:3003`.
*   **Action**: This specific port requirement seems to have been addressed or is no longer a strict constraint, as the terminal output showed an attempt to run on port 3000 and then a prompt to use another port (which was accepted with "y"). The log reflects running on a different port if 3000 is busy.

This session marks a significant step towards a highly dynamic and context-aware UI, where detailed information is presented in compact, self-sizing floating panels directly associated with the main visualization.

## Development Session Summary: [Date of Session]

This session focused on improving the layout and responsiveness of the right-hand modals and sidebar in the proration design application.

### 1. Harmonizing Floating Port Modal Layout

**Problem Identified:**
The initial issue was that the floating port modals (displaying details for Kuala Tanjung, Kandla, Port Qasim) were overlapping each other and other UI elements, rather than stacking in an organized manner. The desired behavior was for the Right Sidebar to be at the top-right, the Cargo Status Modal to sit beneath it, and the Floating Port Modals to stack neatly underneath the Cargo Status Modal.

**Solution & Key Changes:**
To address this, we significantly refactored the positioning logic within the `FloatingPortModal.js` component and updated its CSS.

*   **Enhanced Positioning Logic (`FloatingPortModal.js`):**
    *   The `useEffect` hook for positioning was updated to calculate the `top` position dynamically.
    *   It now considers the bottom boundary of the `.right-sidebar` and the `.cargo-status-modal` (especially when it's sticky).
    *   A specific stacking order for ports (`Kuala Tanjung`, `Kandla`, `Port Qasim`) was implemented. Modals are sorted based on this order, and each modal calculates its vertical offset by summing the heights of the preceding modals in the stack, plus a defined spacing.
    *   A `MutationObserver` was added to monitor the main `.app` container for DOM changes (like modals appearing/disappearing or changing size), triggering a re-calculation of positions to maintain the correct layout.

    ```javascript
    // Simplified example of the core positioning logic in FloatingPortModal.js
    useEffect(() => {
      const updatePosition = () => {
        const rightSidebar = document.querySelector('.right-sidebar');
        const cargoStatusModal = document.querySelector('.cargo-status-modal');
        if (!rightSidebar) return;

        const sidebarRect = rightSidebar.getBoundingClientRect();
        const cargoModalRect = cargoStatusModal ? cargoStatusModal.getBoundingClientRect() : null;

        let startingTop = sidebarRect.bottom + 20; // Start below sidebar
        if (cargoModalRect && cargoStatusModal.classList.contains('sticky')) {
          startingTop = Math.max(startingTop, cargoModalRect.bottom + 20);
        }

        const portOrder = ['Kuala Tanjung', 'Kandla', 'Port Qasim'];
        const allPortModals = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.floating-port-modal'))
          .filter(modal => modal.style.display !== 'none' && modal !== modalRef.current)
          .sort((a, b) => { /* ... sort by portOrder ... */ });

        let finalTop = startingTop;
        const ourIndex = portOrder.indexOf(port);

        allPortModals.forEach(otherModal => {
          const otherPort = otherModal.querySelector('[data-port]')?.getAttribute('data-port') || '';
          const otherIndex = portOrder.indexOf(otherPort);
          if (otherIndex < ourIndex && otherIndex !== -1) {
            const otherRect = otherModal.getBoundingClientRect();
            finalTop += otherRect.height + 20; // 20 is minSpacing
          }
        });
        
        // ... (viewport boundary checks) ...
        setPosition({ left: sidebarRect.left, top: finalTop });
      };

      // ... (event listeners and MutationObserver setup) ...
    }, [port, isVisible, activePort /* ... other dependencies ... */]);
    ```

*   **CSS Adjustments (`FloatingPortModal.css`):**
    *   Removed any default `margin-top` that might interfere with the JavaScript-driven positioning.
    *   Updated responsive styles to ensure modal widths align with the sidebar's width at different breakpoints.
    *   For smaller screens (max-width: 900px), modals were changed to `position: static` to stack vertically within the normal document flow, rather than being fixed.
    *   Modals are hidden on very small screens (max-width: 768px) to prevent UI clutter.

    ```css
    /* Key CSS change in FloatingPortModal.css for responsive stacking */
    @media (max-width: 900px) {
      .floating-port-modal {
        position: relative; /* Changed from fixed */
        width: 100%;
        margin-bottom: 16px;
        position: static; /* Ensures they stack in document flow */
        transform: none !important;
      }
    }
    ```

**Outcome:** The floating port modals now stack harmoniously and in the correct order below the right sidebar and cargo status modal, adapting to screen size changes.

### 2. Implementing a Hyper-Reactive Right Sidebar

**Feature Request & Problem Identified:**
The user requested that the right sidebar's height become dynamic. Previously, it occupied a fixed portion of the viewport height, leading to unnecessary empty space when its internal panels (Control Settings, Time Tracking Analysis) were collapsed.

**Solution & Key Changes:**
This involved centralizing the expanded/collapsed state of the sidebar panels and making the sidebar's CSS responsive to this state.

*   **State Lifting (in `App.js`):**
    *   The `isExpanded` state for `CollapsibleControlModal` and `TimeTrackingPanel` was lifted from these components into the parent `App.js` component. 
    *   `App.js` now holds `controlModalExpanded` and `timeTrackingExpanded` states.
    *   These states and their respective setter functions (`onExpandedChange`) are passed down as props to the child panels.

    ```javascript
    // In App.js
    const [controlModalExpanded, setControlModalExpanded] = useState(false);
    const [timeTrackingExpanded, setTimeTrackingExpanded] = useState(false);

    // ... later in the return statement ...
    <div 
      className={`right-sidebar ${controlModalExpanded || timeTrackingExpanded ? 'has-expanded-content' : 'compact'}`}
    >
      <CollapsibleControlModal
        isExpanded={controlModalExpanded}
        onExpandedChange={setControlModalExpanded}
        // ... other props
      />
      <TimeTrackingPanel
        isExpanded={timeTrackingExpanded}
        onExpandedChange={setTimeTrackingExpanded}
        // ... other props
      />
    </div>
    ```

*   **Child Panel Modifications (`CollapsibleControlModal.js`, `TimeTrackingPanel.js`):**
    *   Removed their internal `isExpanded` state management.
    *   They now use the `isExpanded` prop passed from `App.js` to determine their display state.
    *   Their toggle handlers now call the `onExpandedChange` prop function to update the state in `App.js`.

*   **Dynamic Sidebar CSS (`App.css`):**
    *   The `.right-sidebar` CSS was changed from a fixed height (e.g., `height: calc(100vh - 120px);`) to `height: auto;`.
    *   A `max-height: calc(100vh - 120px);` was retained to prevent it from growing too large.
    *   `overflow-y: auto;` was added to allow scrolling within the sidebar if content exceeds its `max-height`.
    *   Conditional CSS classes `.compact` and `.has-expanded-content` (driven by the panel states in `App.js`) are used to fine-tune appearance, though `height: auto` is the primary driver for reactivity.

    ```css
    /* Key CSS changes in App.css for the right-sidebar */
    .right-sidebar {
      /* ... other styles ... */
      transition: all 0.3s ease;
      height: auto; /* Dynamically adjust height based on content */
      max-height: calc(100vh - 120px); /* Prevent excessive growth */
      overflow-y: auto; /* Allow scroll if content exceeds max-height */
    }

    .right-sidebar.compact {
      min-height: auto; /* Or a specific small height if needed for headers */
    }

    .right-sidebar.has-expanded-content {
      min-height: 200px; /* Ensure some minimum visibility when expanded */
    }
    ```

*   **Floating Port Modal Adaptation:**
    *   The `FloatingPortModal.js` component now receives a `sidebarExpanded` prop from `App.js`.
    *   This prop is added to the dependency array of its main `useEffect` for positioning. This ensures that when the sidebar's height changes (due to its panels expanding/collapsing), the floating port modals correctly recalculate their `top` position relative to the now dynamically-sized sidebar.

**Outcome:** The right sidebar now intelligently adjusts its height based on the expanded state of its child panels, optimizing screen real estate. Floating port modals correctly reposition themselves in response to these changes.

### 3. Clarifying Application Port Usage

**Problem Identified:**
The development server attempted to start on port 3000, which was already in use. The user was unsure which port the application was subsequently running on.

**Solution & Actions:**
*   Explained that React's development server typically tries the next available port (e.g., 3001, 3002) when the default is taken.
*   Used terminal commands to identify running Node processes and the ports they were using:
    *   `lsof -i :3000 -i :3001 -i :3002 -i :3003 -i :3004 | grep node` (or similar variations) helped list processes on specific ports.
    *   `ps aux | grep "react-scripts\|webpack-dev-server" | grep -v grep` helped list all React development server processes.

**Outcome:** Confirmed that instances of the application were running on ports 3000 and 3001, and guided the user that the newest instance (with the latest changes) would likely be on the next available port (e.g., 3002 or 3003).

This session significantly improved the UI's layout, responsiveness, and space efficiency, leading to a more polished and user-friendly experience.

Okay, I will append a new section to your `developmentlog.md` file detailing the recent work on the floating port modals, including the user's refactoring of the positioning logic.

## Session 2024-05-31 (Evening): Advanced Floating Port Modal Positioning

This session involved a user-driven overhaul of the positioning logic for the `FloatingPortModal` component, aiming for a more sophisticated behavior where modals can switch between `absolute` and `fixed` positioning (sticky) based on the scroll position of their corresponding port section in the tube map visualization. The goal was to have the modals align with their port titles and then stick near the top of the viewport as the user scrolls past.

### 1. Feature Request & Desired Behavior

*   **Dynamic Positioning**: The floating port modals should initially be positioned `absolute`ly next to the right sidebar, aligning with their respective port's title or section in the main visualization area.
*   **Sticky Behavior**: As the user scrolls down and the top of a port section reaches a certain threshold near the top of the viewport, the corresponding modal should switch to `position: fixed` (become sticky) near the top.
*   **Boundary Management**:
    *   The sticky modal should not be cut off at the bottom of its port section; if the port section is short, the modal should scroll up with the bottom of the section rather than remaining fixed.
    *   For the first port (Kuala Tanjung), the sticky position should ensure it doesn't overlap with the right sidebar components (Control Settings, Time Tracking Analysis).
*   **Width Alignment**: The modals should maintain a width consistent with the right sidebar.
*   **Visibility**: Modals should only be visible if their `isVisible` prop is true (determined by `activePort` in `App.js`).

### 2. User-Implemented Core Logic Changes (`src/components/FloatingPortModal.js`)

The user heavily refactored the `useEffect` hook responsible for positioning in `FloatingPortModal.js`.

*   **State Management**:
    *   Removed `sidebarWidth` and `shouldShow` states.
    *   Introduced `positionMode` state (`'absolute'` or `'fixed'`) to control the CSS `position` property.

*   **DOM Element References**:
    *   Gets references to `.port-group[data-port="${port}"]`, `.visualization-area`, and `.main-layout`.
    *   Includes a fallback to position modals if these elements aren't immediately found (though this might indicate a race condition or timing issue if elements *should* always be present).

*   **Coordinate Systems & Scroll Handling**:
    *   Crucially, switched to using `window.pageYOffset` (or equivalents) for `scrollTop`, indicating a focus on the main window scroll as the primary driver.
    *   Calculates `leftPosition` for the modals to be to the right of the `.visualization-area`, taking into account the main layout's left offset.
    *   Uses `getBBox()` to get SVG element dimensions (`portGroupBBox`, `portTitle.getBBox()`).

*   **Sticky Logic Implementation**:
    1.  **`stickyViewportThreshold`**: Defines how close to the viewport top a port section needs to be before its modal becomes sticky. This is dynamically adjusted for "Kuala Tanjung" to be below the right sidebar.
    2.  **`portSectionTopInViewport` & `portSectionBottomInViewport`**: Calculates the current Y coordinates of the port section within the browser's viewport.
    3.  **Visibility Check (`isPortVisibleInViewport`)**: Determines if the port section is currently on-screen.
    4.  **Off-Screen Handling**: If the port section is scrolled off-screen, the modal is set to `position: 'absolute'` and its `top` value is calculated to keep it aligned with where its port section *would be* if the page wasn't scrolled (relative to `mainLayoutRect.top`).
    5.  **On-Screen & Sticky Logic**:
        *   If the port section is visible and `portSectionTopInViewport <= stickyViewportThreshold`:
            *   The modal `positionMode` is set to `'fixed'`.
            *   Its `top` is set to `stickyViewportThreshold`.
            *   **Boundary Condition**: If the remaining visible part of the port section (`spaceAtBottomOfPort`) is less than the modal's height, the modal's `fixedTopPosition` is adjusted upwards (effectively scrolling with the bottom of the port section) to prevent it from being cut off by the end of its associated content.
        *   If the port section is visible but *not yet* at the sticky threshold:
            *   The modal `positionMode` is set to `'absolute'`.
            *   Its `top` is aligned with the port title's Y position within the SVG, adjusted for viewport and layout offsets.
            *   Special handling for "Kuala Tanjung" ensures its absolute position is also below the right sidebar.

*   **Event Listeners & Updates**:
    *   Listens to `window` for `resize` and `scroll` events.
    *   Removed the scroll listener from `.visualization-area` (as window scroll is primary).
    *   Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for `handleUpdate` and an `setInterval` for periodic updates.
    *   Dependencies for `useEffect` were changed to `[port, isVisible]`, meaning it re-runs if the port context or its fundamental visibility changes.

*   **Styling**:
    *   The `width` style was removed from the inline styles (relying on CSS).
    *   A class `.is-sticky` is added if `positionMode === 'fixed'`.
    *   The `isHighlighted` prop is now passed to `FloatingSituationalAwarenessPanel`.

### 3. Potential Issues & Observations from User's Code

*   **Complexity**: The positioning logic became quite complex, handling multiple coordinate systems (SVG, viewport, document, layout-relative) and state transitions (`absolute` to `fixed`). This can be hard to debug.
*   **`getBBox()` on Potentially Hidden Elements**: `getBBox()` can return zero dimensions if called on SVG elements that are not rendered or have `display: none`. This could affect calculations if port groups are hidden/shown.
*   **Performance**: Frequent recalculations on scroll (due to `requestAnimationFrame` and `setInterval`) with multiple `getBoundingClientRect` and `getBBox` calls can be performance-intensive, especially with many modals.
*   **Initial Positioning Fallback**: The fallback positioning `top: 200 + (portIndex * 300)` if `portGroup` is not found might indicate that the modals sometimes try to position themselves before the SVG tube map is fully rendered and available in the DOM.
*   **CSS for Width**: The `width` is no longer set inline. It's assumed that `FloatingPortModal.css` will correctly define the width (e.g., to match the sidebar).
*   **`leftPosition + mainLayoutRect.left` for Fixed**: When `positionMode` is `'fixed'`, the `left` style needs to be relative to the viewport. The addition of `mainLayoutRect.left` here suggests that `leftPosition` was initially calculated relative to the `mainLayout` itself, so this correctly converts it to a viewport-relative fixed position.

### Outcome & Current Status

The user has implemented a sophisticated sticky positioning mechanism for the floating port modals. The modals aim to provide a seamless experience where port-specific information remains accessible and contextually relevant as the user navigates the main visualization.

The screenshot provided shows the application running, but no floating modals are visible. This indicates that despite the extensive logic, there might be an issue preventing them from rendering or positioning correctly. Common reasons could be:
1.  The `isVisible` prop being false.
2.  The condition `!portGroup || !visualizationArea || !mainLayout` being true more often than expected, leading to the fallback positioning which might be off-screen or incorrect.
3.  Errors within the complex calculations for `top` and `left` values, or `positionMode` not switching as expected.
4.  CSS issues (e.g., `z-index`, `display`, `opacity`, or the modals being positioned outside the visible area due to incorrect width/height assumptions of parent containers).

Further debugging would involve:
*   Logging the values of key variables (`portSectionTopInViewport`, `stickyViewportThreshold`, `modalHeight`, calculated `top`/`left`, `positionMode`) for each port.
*   Checking if `portGroup` elements are consistently found.
*   Verifying the `isVisible` prop state in `App.js`.
*   Inspecting the modals in the browser's developer tools to see their computed styles and exact DOM positions, even if they appear off-screen.

This session highlights a significant effort to create a highly dynamic and integrated UI, pushing the boundaries of how these informational panels interact with the main content.

## Session 2024-06-01: Advanced Sticky Floating Port Modals (User-Implemented)

This session involved a significant user-driven refactoring of the `FloatingPortModal.js` component to achieve a more sophisticated sticky positioning behavior. The primary goal was for modals to align with their respective port sections in the tube map and then "stick" to the viewport as the user scrolls, ensuring port-specific information remains accessible while its corresponding visual section is in view.

### 1. Feature Request & Desired Behavior (User-Driven)

*   **Contextual Sticky Positioning**: Modals should initially be positioned `absolute`ly, aligned with their port title or section. As the user scrolls and the top of the port section reaches a defined threshold near the viewport top, the modal should transition to `position: fixed` (sticky).
*   **Viewport Boundary Management**: 
    *   When sticky, the modal should not be cut off at the bottom if its associated port section is shorter than the modal. It should start scrolling up with the bottom of its port section.
    *   The first modal (Kuala Tanjung) has special handling to ensure its sticky position is always below the right sidebar components.
*   **Scroll Source**: The primary scroll driving the sticky behavior is the main window scroll, not necessarily the internal scroll of the visualization area (though the visualization area itself is scrollable for its own content).
*   **Width & Visibility**: Modals maintain a width consistent with the right sidebar and are only visible when their `isVisible` prop is true.

### 2. User-Implemented Core Logic Changes (`src/components/FloatingPortModal.js`)

The user heavily refactored the `useEffect` hook responsible for positioning:

*   **State Management**:\n    *   The `position` state was changed to store `{ top: 0, left: 0 }` (previously `right: 16`).\n    *   The `positionMode` state (`'absolute'` or `'fixed'`) continues to control the CSS `position` property.\n\n*   **DOM Element & Coordinate Systems**:\n    *   References are obtained for the specific `.port-group[data-port=\"${port}\"]`, `.visualization-area`, and `.main-layout`.\n    *   **Window Scroll as Primary**: `scrollTop` is now explicitly `window.pageYOffset`.\n    *   **Left Positioning**: `leftPosition` is calculated to place modals to the right of the `.visualization-area`, offset from the `mainLayoutRect.left`.\n    *   SVG Bounding Boxes: `getBBox()` is used for `portGroupBBox` and `portTitleY_SVG` to get dimensions and Y-coordinates within the SVG.\n\n*   **Sticky Logic Implementation Details**:\n    1.  **`stickyViewportThreshold`**: This defines how close to the viewport top a port section's top needs to be before its modal becomes sticky. It's dynamically adjusted for \"Kuala Tanjung\" to be below the right sidebar (`sidebarRect.bottom + 16`).\n    2.  **`portSectionTopInViewport` & `portSectionBottomInViewport`**: These calculate the current Y coordinates of the port section *within the browser's viewport* by taking the `visualizationArea`'s top (`vizRect.top`) and adding the SVG internal Y position (`portSectionTopInSVG`).\n    3.  **`isPortVisibleInViewport`**: A boolean flag to check if any part of the port section is currently visible.\n    4.  **Off-Screen Logic**: \n        *   If `!isPortVisibleInViewport`, the `positionMode` is set to `'absolute'`.\n        *   If the port section is below the viewport, `topValue` is aligned with its title's natural (scrolled-off) position.\n        *   If the port section is above the viewport, `topValue` is set to align the bottom of the modal with the bottom of its (scrolled-off) port section.\n        ```javascript\n        // User's Off-Screen Logic Snippet\n        if (!isPortVisibleInViewport) {\n          setPositionMode('absolute');\n          let topValue;\n          if (portSectionTopInViewport > window.innerHeight) { // Below viewport\n              topValue = portTitleY_SVG + vizRect.top - mainLayoutRect.top; \n          } else { // Above viewport\n              topValue = (portSectionTopInSVG + portSectionHeightInSVG - modalHeight) + vizRect.top - mainLayoutRect.top;\n          }\n          setPosition({ top: topValue, left: leftPosition });\n        }\n        ```\n    5.  **On-Screen & Sticky Logic (if `isPortVisibleInViewport` is true)**:\n        *   If `portSectionTopInViewport <= stickyViewportThreshold` (port section has reached sticky point):\n            *   `positionMode` becomes `'fixed'`.\n            *   `fixedTopPosition` is initially `stickyViewportThreshold`.\n            *   **Boundary Condition**: If the space at the bottom of the port section (relative to `stickyViewportThreshold`) is less than `modalHeight`, `fixedTopPosition` is adjusted upwards (i.e., `portSectionBottomInViewport - modalHeight`). This makes the modal appear to scroll up with the bottom of its section. It's further clamped to ensure it doesn't go above the intended `stickyViewportThreshold` or, for Kuala Tanjung, the calculated safe top.\n            *   The `left` position for fixed mode is `leftPosition + mainLayoutRect.left` to correctly offset it from the viewport edge based on the main layout's position.\n        *   Else (port section visible but not yet at sticky threshold):\n            *   `positionMode` is `'absolute'`.\n            *   `alignmentTop` is calculated based on the port title's Y position within the SVG, adjusted for `vizRect.top`, `mainLayoutRect.top`.\n            *   Kuala Tanjung's `alignmentTop` is further adjusted to be `Math.max` of itself and `sidebarRect.bottom - mainLayoutRect.top + 16`.\n            *   The `left` position is `leftPosition` (relative to `mainLayout`).\n\n*   **Event Listeners**: \n    *   Correctly listens to `window` for `resize` and `scroll`.\n    *   The listener for `.visualization-area` scroll was commented out, reinforcing that `window.scroll` is the primary driver.\n\n### 3. Code Snippet of User's Refined Positioning Logic\n\n```javascript\n// In FloatingPortModal.js - useEffect hook\n// ... (element selections and initial checks) ...\n\nconst scrollTop = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop || document.body.scrollTop || 0;\nconst leftPosition = vizRect.right - mainLayoutRect.left + 16;\n\nconst portGroupBBox = portGroup.getBBox();\nconst portSectionTopInSVG = portGroupBBox.y;\nconst portSectionHeightInSVG = portGroupBBox.height;\nconst portTitleY_SVG = portTitle ? portTitle.getBBox().y : portSectionTopInSVG;\n\nlet stickyViewportThreshold = 10; \nif (port === 'Kuala Tanjung') {\n  const rightSidebar = document.querySelector('.right-sidebar');\n  if (rightSidebar) {\n    const sidebarRect = rightSidebar.getBoundingClientRect();\n    stickyViewportThreshold = Math.max(stickyViewportThreshold, sidebarRect.bottom + 16);\n  }\n}\n\nconst portSectionTopInViewport = vizRect.top + portSectionTopInSVG; \nconst portSectionBottomInViewport = vizRect.top + portSectionTopInSVG + portSectionHeightInSVG;\nconst isPortVisibleInViewport = portSectionBottomInViewport > 0 && portSectionTopInViewport < window.innerHeight;\n\nif (!isPortVisibleInViewport) {\n  setPositionMode('absolute');\n  let topValue;\n  if (portSectionTopInViewport > window.innerHeight) { \n      topValue = portTitleY_SVG + vizRect.top - mainLayoutRect.top; \n  } else { \n      topValue = (portSectionTopInSVG + portSectionHeightInSVG - modalHeight) + vizRect.top - mainLayoutRect.top;\n  }\n  setPosition({ top: topValue, left: leftPosition });\n\n} else {\n  if (portSectionTopInViewport <= stickyViewportThreshold) {\n    setPositionMode('fixed');\n    let fixedTopPosition = stickyViewportThreshold;\n    const spaceAtBottomOfPort = portSectionBottomInViewport - stickyViewportThreshold;\n    if (spaceAtBottomOfPort < modalHeight) {\n      fixedTopPosition = portSectionBottomInViewport - modalHeight;\n      fixedTopPosition = Math.min(fixedTopPosition, stickyViewportThreshold);\n      fixedTopPosition = Math.max(fixedTopPosition, (port === 'Kuala Tanjung' ? stickyViewportThreshold : 10) );\n    }\n    setPosition({ top: fixedTopPosition, left: leftPosition + mainLayoutRect.left });\n\n  } else {\n    setPositionMode('absolute');\n    let alignmentTop = portTitleY_SVG + vizRect.top - mainLayoutRect.top;\n    if (port === 'Kuala Tanjung') {\n      const rightSidebar = document.querySelector('.right-sidebar');\n      if (rightSidebar) {\n        const sidebarRect = rightSidebar.getBoundingClientRect();\n        const minTopAbs = sidebarRect.bottom - mainLayoutRect.top + 16;\n        alignmentTop = Math.max(alignmentTop, minTopAbs);\n      }\n    }\n    setPosition({ top: alignmentTop, left: leftPosition });\n  }\n}\n// ... (updatePosition is called by event listeners & interval) ...\n```\n\n### 4. Addressing Console Warnings\n\n*   **React Warning (`jsx` attribute)**: A warning `Warning: Received true for a non-boolean attribute jsx` in `TimeTrackingPanel.js` was fixed by changing `<style jsx>{\`...\`}</style>` to `<style>{\`...\`}</style>`. This is because `styled-jsx` syntax is specific to Next.js or projects explicitly using that library, and this is a standard React app.\n*   **ESLint Warnings (Unused Variables)**: \n    *   The `console.log` statement for debugging in `FloatingPortModal.js` (line 119) was commented out to reduce console noise and potential performance impact.\n    *   Unused variables `portTitleTopViewport` and `scrollTop` (within specific scopes where they were re-declared or not used) in `FloatingPortModal.js` were removed to clear ESLint warnings.\n\n### Outcome & Current Status\n\nThe user has significantly advanced the sticky positioning logic for the floating port modals. The application now uses a combination of `absolute` and `fixed` positioning, driven by the main window's scroll position and the visibility of the corresponding port sections within the viewport. Special considerations for the first port (Kuala Tanjung) ensure it respects the sidebar's position.\n\nWhile the provided screenshots in the subsequent user message still indicate that the modals might not be appearing or sticking as intended, the console logs (from the user's next message) show that the `positionMode` is switching (e.g., Kuala Tanjung to 'fixed', Kandla/Port Qasim to 'absolute') and `top` values are being calculated. This suggests the core logic is running, but there might still be issues in the exact coordinate calculations, CSS (e.g., `left` vs `right` properties, `z-index`, final `width`/`height` of modals), or how the SVG element coordinates (`getBBox()`) are translating to viewport/document coordinates, especially in conjunction with the scrollable `.visualization-area`.\n\nThe warnings related to `jsx` attributes and unused variables have been addressed, cleaning up the console output for easier debugging of the main positioning issue.\n
